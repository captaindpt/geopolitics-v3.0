[2025-04-18 14:24:58.481]             From ITALY: Greetings from Italy. To ensure a peaceful start, I propose a non-aggression pact where I agree not to move into Tyrolia if you agree not to move into Trieste or Venice. Perhaps we can discuss a joint action against another power such as Turkey.

As the game begins, I propose a non-aggression pact where we agree that you do not move your fleet into the English Channel and I do not move my fleet into the Mid-Atlantic Ocean or the English Channel. Furthermore, a potential alliance against Germany might be advantageous for both of us. What are your thoughts?
[2025-04-18 14:24:58.482]             From GERMANY: Hello, England. As Germany, I am interested in forming an alliance with you.

[2025-04-18 14:24:58.482]             From GERMANY: Hello, France. I believe that a non-aggression pact could benefit us both early on.

Based on a previous round, we proposed that F ANK moves to BLA while RUSSIA moves F SEV to RUM. Plan: (1) Agree with Italy on the non-aggression pact. (2) Follow up with Russia on the previously proposed plan.

[2025-04-18 14:30:50.274]             From GERMANY: Hello Austria, thank you for reaching out. I agree that maintaining a peaceful border in the Munich-Tyrolia region would be beneficial for both of us. For now, I plan to keep my intentions peaceful towards Tyrolia until the end of the first year. What are your thoughts on a mutual non-aggression pact specifically for the Munich-Tyrolia border until the end of 1901?
[2025-04-18 14:30:50.274]             From ITALY: Thank you for your proposal. I agree to a non-aggression pact where neither of us moves into each other's home territories this turn. I also like your idea of an alliance against Turkey. How would you suggest we coordinate our efforts to secure our southern borders?
[2025-04-18 14:30:50.274]             From RUSSIA: Hello Austria, I agree that keeping Galicia as a neutral zone makes sense for now. An alliance against Turkey sounds promising. How do you propose we coordinate our moves against Turkey while ensuring our borders remain secure?

[2025-04-18 14:30:50.274]             From GERMANY: Hello England, your proposal for an alliance against France sounds interesting. However, France has also proposed a non-aggression pact. I need to carefully consider both options before making a firm decision. However, I am open to discussing a potential cooperation against France once I have a clearer picture. What specific moves do you plan for the first round?
[2025-04-18 14:30:50.274]             From RUSSIA: Hello England, I am open to your proposal where you aim for Norway while I focus on Sweden and the Baltic. However, I need assurance that you will not make any moves on St. Petersburg. Can we agree on that?

Regarding the potential alliance against Germany, I am interested. What specific actions do you suggest we take against Germany this year? Perhaps a coordinated attack could be beneficial for us both.
[2025-04-18 14:30:50.275]             From GERMANY: Hello France, I agree that a non-aggression pact could be beneficial for both of us. I propose that we agree not to attack each other’s home centers until the end of the first year. Additionally, I suggest that neither of us makes moves into Burgundy (for us) and neither of us makes moves into Ruhr and Kiel (for you). Does this sound agreeable to you?
[2025-04-18 14:30:50.275]             From ITALY: Thank you for proposing a non-aggression pact. I agree that we should not make aggressive moves towards each other's home centers initially. I plan to focus on the Balkans as you suggested. Let's keep our communication open for future cooperation.

[2025-04-18 14:30:50.275]             From ENGLAND: I appreciate your proposal for a division of Scandinavia where I aim for Norway while you aim for Sweden and Denmark. To make this work, can you assure me that you will not make any aggressive moves towards the North Sea or Belgium? We need to make sure that our expansion plans do not put us in conflict.
[2025-04-18 14:30:50.275]             From FRANCE: Hello Germany, I agree to a non-aggression pact where I focus on Iberia and the Mediterranean while you aim for Scandinavia. Avoiding conflict over Belgium could indeed help us both expand initially. However, we might need to discuss Belgium's status in the future.
[2025-04-18 14:30:50.275]             From ITALY: Thank you for your non-aggression pact proposal regarding Tyrolia. However, Tyrolia is mainly a border with Austria. I agree to avoid any conflict there and focus on our respective other fronts. However, my main focus is currently on the Mediterranean and the Balkans.
[2025-04-18 14:30:50.275]             From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, I agree to a non-aggression pact so that we can both focus on other fronts. I will focus on Turkey and Austria while you handle France and England. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful.

How about you keep your fleet in Constantinople while I still move my fleet from Sevastopol to Rumania? This way, we can still make strategic gains while avoiding any immediate conflicts.

For Austria, the non-aggression pact should be reaffirmed for the Munich-Tyrolia border until the end of 1901.

[2025-04-18 14:47:38.837]             From AUSTRIA: Let us continue our non-aggression pact. Given our previous discussions, I suggest that you move your fleet in TYS to ION so that together we can target Greece. A VEN can stay put or support our moves in the Balkans. A APU can secure your domestic centers if necessary.
[2025-04-18 14:47:38.837]             From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I hope our non-aggression pact is still in place where you agreed not to move into Piedmont if I do not move into Marseilles. I'd like to propose a more detailed cooperation agreement for the Mediterranean where France might support you in actions against Austria or Turkey while you support France in securing Spain and Portugal. What are your thoughts on this?
[2025-04-18 14:47:38.837]             From GERMANY: Although there might be less immediate interaction between us, I propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1901. Let us keep our borders peaceful and possibly coordinate on any future moves related to Austria or France.
[2025-04-18 14:47:38.837]             From TURKEY: Hello, I see that you did not move into the Ionian Sea in the spring movement phase. I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact for the fall movement phase where I will not move into the Aegean Sea if you do not move into the Ionian Sea. Do you agree to continue this agreement for the fall movement phase?

[2025-04-18 14:47:38.837]             From AUSTRIA: Let’s continue our three-way alliance against Turkey. I plan to move A SER to BUL and F ALB to GRE. Could you support us by moving your F SEV to the Black Sea and A GAL to support an attack on Bulgaria or hold to defend against possible Turkish moves?
[2025-04-18 14:47:38.837]             From ENGLAND: Hello Russia, I propose that we finalize our plan for Scandinavia. I aim to take Norway while you aim for Sweden. How do you feel about this plan? Additionally, I need to ensure that there are no conflicts in the North Sea and Baltic. Can we make a clear agreement?
[2025-04-18 14:47:38.837]             From GERMANY: I need to follow up regarding your intentions. A non-aggression pact until the end of 1901 would be beneficial for us both. What do you suggest?
[2025-04-18 14:47:38.837]             From TURKEY: Hello, it seems that our initial plan for the spring movement phase was for you to move F SEV to RUM while I move F ANK to BLA. However, F SEV is still in Sevastopol. What are your plans for the fall movement phase? Should we still aim for a coordinated move such as you moving F SEV to RUM while I support with A BUL to RUM? Let us make sure we are on the same page.

[2025-04-18 14:47:38.837]             From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I hope our non-aggression pact from Spring 1901 still holds true—no move into Ionian Sea if no move into Aegean Sea. Our fleet is currently in the Tyrrhenian Sea. I believe it makes sense for us to maintain a peaceful border while focusing on other fronts. Perhaps we could discuss a plan for mutual support or non-aggression in the Mediterranean. What are your thoughts?
[2025-04-18 14:47:38.837]             From RUSSIA: Greetings, Turkey. Given our units in the Black Sea region, it makes sense for us to avoid an immediate conflict. How about we focus on a joint plan against Austria while ensuring peace on our border? For now, I suggest you keep your focus on the Balkans while I aim for a stable position in the north.
