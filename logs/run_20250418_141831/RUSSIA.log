  From GERMANY: Hello, Russia. Given our shared border, it makes sense for us to establish a non-aggression pact so we can both focus on other fronts. I propose that you focus on Turkey and Austria while I deal with France and England. What is your stance on this?
  From TURKEY: Greetings. To ensure a peaceful opening, I propose that I move my fleet F ANK to the Black Sea while you move your fleet F SEV to RUM. This way, we avoid any conflict and can both make strategic gains. What are your thoughts?
