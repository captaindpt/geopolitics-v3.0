  From GERMANY: Hello Austria, thank you for reaching out. I agree that maintaining a peaceful border in the Munich-Tyrolia region would be beneficial for both of us. For now, I plan to keep my intentions peaceful towards Tyrolia until the end of the first year. What are your thoughts on a mutual non-aggression pact specifically for the Munich-Tyrolia border until the end of 1901?
  From ITALY: Thank you for your proposal. I agree to a non-aggression pact where neither of us moves into each other's home territories this turn. I also like your idea of an alliance against Turkey. How would you suggest we coordinate our efforts to secure our southern borders?
  From RUSSIA: Hello Austria, I agree that keeping Galicia as a neutral zone makes sense for now. An alliance against Turkey sounds promising. How do you propose we coordinate our moves against Turkey while ensuring our borders remain secure?

Our units are currently positioned in Venice and Apulia. I believe it makes sense for us to maintain a peaceful border while focusing on other fronts. Perhaps we could discuss a joint action against Turkey or another plan that could benefit us both. What are your thoughts?
  From RUSSIA: Hello, Austria. It would be beneficial for us to have a peaceful border agreement for now. However, I am open to discussing any joint plans against Turkey. What are your intentions for the next round?
  From TURKEY: Hello, I hope we can maintain peaceful relations this fall. My unit in Bulgaria is there for defensive purposes. Do you have any plans that might affect us? Let us make sure we do not accidentally clash.
