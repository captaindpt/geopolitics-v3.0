  From FRANCE: I agree to your non-aggression pact where you focus on the North Sea while I focus on the Bay of Biscay and Spain. I will keep my fleet in Brest out of the English Channel this turn. Let us both expand safely without threatening each other.
  From GERMANY: Hello England, your proposal for an alliance against France sounds interesting. However, France has also proposed a non-aggression pact. I need to carefully consider both options before making a firm decision. However, I am open to discussing a potential cooperation against France once I have a clearer picture. What specific moves do you plan for the first round?

Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
