  From ENGLAND: I agree to your non-aggression pact where I do not move my fleet in London to the English Channel if you do not move your fleet in Brest to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean or the English Channel. Regarding the potential alliance against Germany, I am interested. What specific actions do you suggest we take against Germany this year? Perhaps a coordinated attack could be beneficial for us both.
  From GERMANY: Hello France, I agree that a non-aggression pact could be beneficial for both of us. I propose that we agree not to attack each other’s home centers until the end of the first year. Additionally, I suggest that neither of us makes moves into Burgundy (for us) and neither of us makes moves into Ruhr and Kiel (for you). Does this sound agreeable to you?
  From ITALY: Thank you for proposing a non-aggression pact. I agree that we should not make aggressive moves towards each other's home centers initially. I plan to focus on the Balkans as you suggested. Let's keep our communication open for future cooperation.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
