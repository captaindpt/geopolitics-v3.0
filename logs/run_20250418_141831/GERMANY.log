  From AUSTRIA: Hello Germany, I agree to a non-aggression pact and am open to future cooperation against either Russia or Italy if necessary. For now, let us focus on securing our borders and maintaining open lines of communication.
  From ENGLAND: I appreciate your proposal for a division of Scandinavia where I aim for Norway while you aim for Sweden and Denmark. To make this work, can you assure me that you will not make any aggressive moves towards the North Sea or Belgium? We need to make sure that our expansion plans do not put us in conflict.
  From FRANCE: Hello Germany, I agree to a non-aggression pact where I focus on Iberia and the Mediterranean while you aim for Scandinavia. Avoiding conflict over Belgium could indeed help us both expand initially. However, we might need to discuss Belgium's status in the future.
  From ITALY: Thank you for your non-aggression pact proposal regarding Tyrolia. However, Tyrolia is mainly a border with Austria. I agree to avoid any conflict there and focus on our respective other fronts. However, my main focus is currently on the Mediterranean and the Balkans.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, I agree to a non-aggression pact so that we can both focus on other fronts. I will focus on Turkey and Austria while you handle France and England. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
