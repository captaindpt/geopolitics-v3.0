Additionally, I propose a potential alliance against Turkey where we can work together to secure our southern borders. What are your thoughts?
  From FRANCE: Hello, Italy. I suggest a non-aggression pact where we agree not to make aggressive moves towards each other's home centers initially. Perhaps you could focus on the Balkans while I focus on the Atlantic coast. What are your thoughts on this?
  From GERMANY: Hello, Italy. To avoid early conflict in Tyrolia, I suggest a non-aggression pact. This would allow us both to focus on other fronts. What do you think about this?

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
