Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello Turkey, I am open to discussing common interests and potential future alliances. What did you have in mind?
  From ITALY: Thank you for being open to discussing potential future alliances. I would like to keep our lines of communication open as well. For now, let us agree that if you keep your fleet out of the Ionian Sea, I will keep mine out of the Aegean Sea. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: Hello Turkey, while I appreciate your proposal for a peaceful opening, I am a bit concerned about your fleet entering the Black Sea. How about you keep your fleet in Constantinople while I still move my fleet from Sevastopol to Rumania? This way, we can still make strategic gains while avoiding any immediate conflicts.

Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

Another plan might be to make a more cautious move where F ANK holds in ANK or moves to CON while A CON can move to BUL.

Another part of the plan could be that A CON supports F ANK to BLA instead of moving to BUL, but that makes us more aggressive and might lead to a bounce if Russia moves to BLA."
