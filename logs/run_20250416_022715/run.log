[2025-04-16 02:27:54.446]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Reasoning: As Austria, my main goal is to secure my core territories (Vie, Bud, Tri) and try to ally with either Italy or Russia against Turkey. I need to make sure that Italy does not attack Trieste and instead focus on a joint attack on Turkey. Another option is to ally with Russia for a joint attack on Turkey. Plan: Propose a non-aggression pact with Italy where Italy does not move A VEN to Trieste and instead focuses on a joint attack on Turkey. Propose a similar non-aggression pact and joint attack plan with Russia where Russia moves A WAR to GAL and F SEV to BLA. Update memory with the proposals made.

[2025-04-16 02:28:28.410]         >> Thought (ENGLAND): Reasoning: As England, my main goals are to secure the seas around me (North Sea, Norwegian Sea, English Channel) and aim for Scandinavia. I need to make sure that France does not move into the English Channel (ENG) so I should propose a DMZ there. Similarly, I need to make sure that Germany does not move into the North Sea (NTH), so I should propose a DMZ there as well. Additionally, I need to make a friendly opening with Russia to make sure that we do not conflict in Scandinavia. I should propose that England aims for Norway while Russia aims for Sweden. Plan: Propose a DMZ in the English Channel to France, a DMZ in the North Sea to Germany, and a friendly division of Scandinavia with Russia.
