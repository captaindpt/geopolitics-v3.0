This way, we can both expand without threatening each other. Let us keep each other informed of our plans.\n  From ENGLAND: Hello Germany, I appreciate your non-aggression pact proposal and potential alliance. A focus on France might be a bit premature until we see more moves. However, I am open to a joint move where you could show a clear intent against Russia, such as moving A BER to PRU or supporting actions against Russia. For now, I aim to secure Norway with F LON - NTH and might need support if France makes a hostile move.\n  From FRANCE: Hello Germany, a non-aggression pact sounds interesting. However, I need a more specific agreement. If you agree not to move into Burgundy, I could focus on other fronts such as England or Italy. However, I need to make sure that you will not make any aggressive moves against me.\n  From ITALY: Hello Germany, I agree to a non-aggression pact. However, focusing on Austria seems a bit aggressive at the moment. However, I will make sure to keep an eye on France while you focus on Russia or England.\n  From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, I accept your non-aggression pact proposal.
