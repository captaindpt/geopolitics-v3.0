Turkey has units that could move into Bulgaria, Serbia, or Greece. Russia has a unit in Warsaw which could threaten Galicia. Plan for round 1: 1) Propose a non-aggression pact with Italy. 2) Propose an alliance with Turkey for a division of the Balkans where Austria aims for Serbia and Greece while Turkey could focus on Bulgaria and defend against Russia. 3) Communicate with Russia to ensure a peaceful border and make it clear that any move into Galicia would be seen as hostile."
