Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I agree to a joint action against Turkey. I will move F TRI to the Adriatic Sea (which is a necessary step before moving to Albania). However, I need assurance that you will not make any aggressive moves towards Galicia.
  From ENGLAND: Hello Russia, I find your proposal for a Northern Triple alliance with Germany intriguing. An alliance to divide Scandinavia sounds like a viable plan. However, I need to confirm that Germany is also part of this plan. Once we have a three-way agreement, I am open to moving my fleet from London to the North Sea while you move your fleet from St. Petersburg to the Gulf of Bothnia. Let us make sure that Germany is on board as well.
  From FRANCE: I am interested in a Franco-Russian alliance against Germany. A MAR to Burgundy makes sense. However, could you provide a more detailed plan on how we can effectively put pressure on Germany? For instance, what would be our next steps if I move A MAR to Burgundy and you move A WAR to Galicia?
  From GERMANY: Hello Russia, I am interested in working together against Austria. However, a direct move to Tyrolia might be too aggressive initially. I suggest I move A MUN to Silesia or Bohemia while you move A WAR to Galicia. This way, we can make a coordinated yet cautious move against Austria.
  From TURKEY: Hello Russia, I am interested in your Juggernaut alliance proposal. Moving A CON to Bulgaria sounds like a good plan to pressure Austria. However, let us make sure that both of us make coordinated moves. I will move A CON to Bulgaria as you suggested, and I hope that A WAR will indeed move to Galicia. Let us work together to divide Austria fairly.

You are RUSSIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The game has just started with the Spring 1901 Movement phase. As this is the first phase of the game, all seven powers (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey) have made their initial moves. However, no specific key events or state changes are mentioned other than the fact that the game has started. Thus, the main event here is that the game has officially commenced and all powers have made their first set of moves for the Spring 1901 Movement phase.}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello Russia, I want to make sure that our joint action against Turkey is still on track. You should aim for Bulgaria and Rumania while I aim for Greece and Serbia. Can you confirm your plans for this round?
  From ENGLAND: I am interested in your proposal for a Northern Triple alliance including Germany. Could you confirm that Germany is part of the plan? I propose a plan where England aims for Norway while Russia aims for Sweden. How do you feel about that?
  From GERMANY: I am glad you expressed interest in a non-aggression pact and a potential alliance against Austria. However, with four units, you are a significant force, and any misunderstanding could lead to conflicts. I suggest that any moves I make are not a threat to you. Could you clarify your intentions for the next few turns?
  From TURKEY: Hello Russia, I hope our Juggernaut alliance against Austria is still on track. I plan to move A BUL to another location such as Serbia or Greece while you should move A WAR to Galicia. Let's make sure we coordinate our moves effectively.

  From AUSTRIA: I am still committed to our joint action against Turkey. I plan to secure Serbia and aim for Greece. Can you make sure that your units do not make any moves towards Serbia or Galicia? How do you plan to handle Turkey's fleet in the Black Sea?
  From ENGLAND: I reaffirm our agreement on the peaceful division of Scandinavia where you aim for Sweden while I aim for Norway. However, it is important that any aggressive moves towards the North Sea (NTH) or Norwegian Sea (NWG) would be seen as a breach of trust. Let us continue to respect this agreement.

  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact for the current year. Let us continue to respect each other's borders and focus on our respective goals. I trust that we can maintain a peaceful border.
  From ITALY: Hello Russia, I agree to a non-aggression pact for the current year. I am open to discussing a potential alliance against Turkey. However, I need to make sure that any such alliance does not conflict with other existing agreements.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello, I want to reaffirm our joint action against Turkey. What are your plans for your fleet in Rumania (F RUM) and army in Galicia (A GAL) this round? It is important that we continue to coordinate our efforts against Turkey while ensuring that our own borders remain secure.
  From ENGLAND: Russia, our Northern Triple alliance plan should still hold. However, I need confirmation that you respect the division of Scandinavia. Our fleet in NTH needs to stay free from any threats from your fleets. How do you plan to proceed?
  From FRANCE: Hello Russia, I expressed interest in an alliance previously. I need a more detailed plan on how you plan to expand and how we could support each other. Perhaps we can coordinate our actions against Germany and Austria. What are your current strategic goals?
  From GERMANY: While we have agreed on a non-aggression pact, your fleet in Sweden (F SWE) makes me a bit uneasy. Can we agree to a standoff in the Baltic Sea? I propose that my F BAL stays in place (F BAL H) and that your F SWE does not make any aggressive moves towards me. Let us focus on our respective goals elsewhere.
  From ITALY: Hello, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given your strong position in the Balkans, would you be interested in a coordinated action against Turkey? Perhaps we could discuss a plan where we both make moves that could help us gain more supply centers in the region.
  From TURKEY: Let us continue our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. I propose that my A BUL moves to SER supported by A CON. Can you support this move with your F RUM or make a move on BUD with your A GAL? This will help us make significant gains against Austria.

  From AUSTRIA: Thank you for your message. Our joint action against Turkey has indeed been fruitful thus far. I plan to continue working together against Turkey. What specific moves do you have in mind for this round? I want to make sure that our actions are well-coordinated so that we can make further gains while keeping our mutual borders secure.
  From ENGLAND: Hello Russia, I agree that our peaceful division of Scandinavia seems to be working well so far. I hope we can continue to honor this agreement and avoid any conflicts in the Baltic Sea region. Let us make sure that our actions are well-coordinated so that we do not make a new enemy while trying to maintain a stable northern front.
  From FRANCE: Russia, our previous discussions about a non-aggression pact and a potential alliance against Germany or England are still on the table. To support each other this round, I suggest that you put pressure on Germany from the east while I do so from the west. Perhaps you could move your F SWE to support an attack on Denmark while I make moves against Germany's western front.
  From ITALY: Hello, our non-aggression pact is still on the table. Given your position in Galicia and Rumania, a joint action against Austria seems like a viable strategy. How can we support each other specifically this round? What are your plans for A GAL and F RUM?
  From TURKEY: Hello Russia, I am also concerned about Austria's gains. I propose that we continue our Juggernaut alliance and make a coordinated attack on Austria. I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. Could you move A GAL to BUD (possibly supported by A UKR) for a two-pronged attack? Also, F BLA can support F RUM if necessary. What do you think?

You are RUSSIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Spring 1902 Movement phase, no supply centers changed hands. The new units built by France, England, Turkey, and Italy (one unit each), and Austria and Russia (two units each) were likely deployed during this phase, although specific troop movements are not detailed here. The lack of supply center captures indicates that the powers may have focused on consolidating their positions and making strategic maneuvers without directly capturing any new territories."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: It seems that no new supply centers were captured in the Spring 1902 Movement phase. We need to make a more coordinated effort against Turkey for the Fall 1902 Movement phase. I propose that I move A VIE -> GAL if you can support this move or move your A GAL elsewhere. A BUD can support A VIE -> GAL if necessary. A SER can move to BUL if your F RUM supports that move or moves to BUL itself. F AEG can attack Smyrna or support a potential move to Constantinople. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From ENGLAND: Russia, I see that you have a fleet in Sweden. What are your plans for this unit? I want to make sure that our previous agreement on a peaceful division of Scandinavia still holds true.
  From FRANCE: Dear Russia, I hope our non-aggression pact is still valid. I would like to make sure that any coordinated action against Germany is still on the table. If you are still interested, let us plan a joint action to keep Germany in check. What are your thoughts on this?
  From GERMANY: Hello, Russia. Our previous agreement included a non-aggression pact where we respect each other’s borders and focus on our respective goals. I want to reaffirm that pact and make sure that any mutual support against other powers still holds. Your units in Sweden and Galicia seem poised for action; what are your current plans?
  From ITALY: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I am considering a joint action against either Austria or Turkey. Would you be interested in coordinating an attack on Austria? For instance, if you could support an attack on TRI or VIE, it could be beneficial for both of us. Alternatively, if you prefer, we could also coordinate against Turkey where my fleet in ION could support an attack on BUL or CON.
  From TURKEY: Dear Russia, our Juggernaut alliance against Austria seems to be progressing well. I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. Could you move A GAL to BUD supported by A UKR? Additionally, what are your plans for dealing with the Austrian fleet in AEG? It seems like a potential threat to both of us.

  From AUSTRIA: We agree with the plan where A VIE moves to Galicia if supported by you or if A GAL moves elsewhere. A BUD will support A VIE to Galicia. A SER should move to Bulgaria if supported by F RUM. F AEG can either attack Smyrna or support a potential move to Constantinople.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Russia, I agree that the Northern Triple alliance is working well. I plan to keep my fleet in Norway while you keep your fleet in Sweden. However, it might be wise for us to make some aggressive moves against Germany or France. Do you have any plans to make any such moves this round? Your support might be crucial.
  From FRANCE: I reaffirm our long-term alliance where I focus on Germany while you focus on Austria and Turkey. It would be helpful if you could make a move against Germany if possible, such as by pressuring Berlin or supporting any French moves against Munich or Ruh. Let us keep supporting each other.
  From GERMANY: Our non-aggression pact remains valid. I agree to a standoff in the Baltic Sea where my F BAL stays in place if your F SWE does not make aggressive moves.
  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact is still in place and I am open to continuing our coordinated actions against Turkey. However, I am also concerned about Austria's growing power. Let us discuss a possible joint action against Austria as well.
  From TURKEY: Your plan sounds good. I will move A BUL to SER and appreciate your support from F RUM. Let us make a strong push against Austria this round.

REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json

  From FRANCE: Hello, it seems that no new supply centers were captured in the last movement phase. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and continue our coordinated action against Germany. What are your plans for the next year?
  From GERMANY: I see that you have a fleet in SWE where I also have a fleet. Can you clarify your intentions here? We need to make sure that our non-aggression pact is still respected.
  From ITALY: Dear Russia, no supply centers were gained in the last round. We previously discussed joint actions against both Austria and Turkey.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello Russia, I am glad that our joint action against Turkey seems to be making progress. I hold Serbia and Greece and aim to make well-coordinated moves against Turkey. Since you aim to secure Bulgaria next, I will make sure that my units in Serbia and Greece are well-positioned to support any actions against Turkey. Let us make sure that our plans are well-coordinated.
  From ENGLAND: Hello Russia, I appreciate our continued cooperation in the Northern Triple alliance. It seems to be working well so far. I aim to keep supporting your moves in Scandinavia while you aim for Sweden. However, we need to keep an eye on both Germany and France. What are your thoughts on the current situation and what support do you need from me?
  From FRANCE: Greetings Russia, I am glad that our cooperation is working well. I successfully took KIE and plan to hold it. Let us continue to focus on Germany while you handle Austria and Turkey. Keep communication open so that we can coordinate our strategies effectively.
  From GERMANY: Hello Russia. It seems that there might be some confusion regarding the situation in Sweden. Currently, my fleet is in SWE and it seems there is a mention of a unit of yours there as well. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and make it clear that a part of that pact should include a standoff line in the Baltic Sea where neither of us makes aggressive moves against Sweden.
  From ITALY: Greetings, Russia. Our non-aggression pact and coordinated action against Turkey are still in place. Once I build a new fleet in Naples and move it to the Ionian Sea, I can make moves against Smyrna. Until then, let us continue to work together and keep each other informed of our plans against Turkey.
  From TURKEY: Hello Russia, I agree that our Juggernaut alliance against Austria should continue. Unfortunately, our attacks on Buda and Serbia did not succeed last round. I suggest we make a new round of coordinated attacks where you support my move into Serbia while you simultaneously aim for Budapest. What are your thoughts on this plan?

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

You are RUSSIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Winter 1902 Adjustment phase, no new center ownership changes were recorded. The primary activity of this phase is typically adjusting military forces based on the supply centers controlled by each power, though specific unit adjustments are not provided here."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1903M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A UKR, F RUM, A STP, A MOS

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello, let's continue our joint action against Turkey. I propose that my A SER moves to BUL this turn. Would your F RUM support this move? Also, what are your plans for A UKR? I need to make sure that our actions are well-coordinated.
  From ENGLAND: Let us continue to honor the Northern Triple alliance terms and keep Scandinavia peaceful. What are your plans for the current season?
  From FRANCE: Dear Russia, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact and propose a coordinated action against Germany. You could move your unit in Moscow (A MOS) to Warsaw (WAR) or your unit in Ukraine (A UKR) to Galicia (GAL) to put pressure on Germany's unit in Warsaw (A WAR). This would help us in our joint efforts against Germany.
  From GERMANY: Dear Russia, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. What are your plans for A STP and A MOS? It is important for me to ensure that any movements in the Baltic or towards Warsaw are peaceful. Let us keep our focus on our respective goals and respect our borders.
  From ITALY: Hello, Russia. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Would you be interested in a joint action against Turkey? I could move my fleet from NAP to ION and aim for AEG if you support by attacking Turkey from RUM. Let us discuss how we can make a coordinated move.
  From TURKEY: Dear Russia, it seems that our previous attempts to take BUD and SER were unsuccessful. However, Austria is now in a very weak position with only three supply centers left. Let us continue our Juggernaut alliance and make a new round of coordinated attacks. I suggest that you move A UKR to support A BUL to SER while I move A BUL to SER. Additionally, if you can move F RUM to support A BUL to GRE, that would help us secure another supply center. What are your thoughts on this plan?

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1903M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, thank you for reaffirming our joint action against Turkey. As you mentioned, I now hold Greece and Serbia. I propose that I aim for Bulgaria next with A SER -> BUL (supported by F GRE if necessary) while you aim for Rumania. Your F RUM could support my A SER -> BUL if needed. I also agree that Italy seems to be growing stronger, so if Italy makes any aggressive moves, a joint action against Italy might be a good idea. However, for now, let us focus on Turkey until Italy makes a move against us.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. F NWY does not intend to make any aggressive moves towards STP. We need to make sure that our alliance remains strong and that we continue to make strategic gains elsewhere. F NWY might be used to support actions against Germany or hold its position in the North Sea.
  From FRANCE: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our long-term alliance where I focus on Germany while you focus on Austria and Turkey. I agree that Italy seems to be gaining strength. If they make any aggressive moves, a joint action against Italy could be a viable option. However, for now, focusing on Germany and Turkey seems most strategic. Do you need any specific support from me against Turkey or Austria?
  From GERMANY: Hello, Russia. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. F SWE will not make any aggressive moves against STP. It might be used for defensive purposes or to block potential threats in the North Sea or Baltic Sea. What are your plans for A MOS and A UKR, as they could potentially threaten my army in Warsaw?
  From ITALY: Dear Russia, our non-aggression pact stands. We are willing to make a coordinated action against Turkey where we make moves against Smyrna while you make moves against Bulgaria and Constantinople. However, a direct move against Smyrna might require us to make a fleet movement such as towards the Aegean Sea. A VIE might be used for a defensive position or a move against Austria if necessary. Let us make a detailed plan.
  From TURKEY: I reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. My plan for F BLA is to either keep it stationary or move it to AEG as part of a plan to capture GRE. I assure you that F BLA will not make any aggressive moves towards RUM or SEV. For this round, I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. Can F RUM support A BUL to SER?

CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: It seems that our joint action against Turkey has made some progress as you now control Rumania. I aim to make a move on Bulgaria while you should aim for Constantinople or Ankara. Could you support my move A SER -> BUL with your F RUM? Additionally, could you clarify your intentions for A UKR? Our plan was that you would not make moves towards Galicia. Let us continue our cooperation to ensure that Turkey is effectively countered.
  From ENGLAND: The Northern Triple alliance is still important to us. Let us make sure that our units do not make any aggressive moves against each other. How can we further support each other against Germany and France?
  From FRANCE: Dear Russia, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given that Germany seems to be a common threat, I propose a coordinated action where you put pressure on Germany's Eastern front while we attack from the West. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From GERMANY: Dear Russia, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I hope that you do not make any moves towards Germany's territories such as Sweden or Berlin. Let us respect our borders and focus on our respective goals.
  From ITALY: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given that Turkey is a common threat, would you be interested in a joint action against them? I could support your movements into Bulgaria or Constantinople while you support my movements into Serbia or Greece.
  From TURKEY: Our Juggernaut alliance has been successful thus far. Italy has captured Vienna from Austria. I suggest we continue our coordinated attacks on Austria's remaining centers. I plan to make a move on Serbia or Greece this round. Could we coordinate such that your F RUM supports my A BUL to SER if another round of movement is needed? Additionally, if you need any support against Germany or any other power, let me know.

Phase: S1903R
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, The joint action against Turkey seems to be making progress. For Fall 1903, I propose that A SER should move to Bulgaria supported by F RUM if possible (A SER -> BUL, F RUM supports A SER -> BUL), while F GRE should move to the Aegean Sea (F GRE -> AEG) to make a future attack on Smyrna or Constantinople. What are your plans for A UKR and F RUM in the Fall round? It is crucial that we maintain our cooperation.
  From ENGLAND: Hello, the Northern Triple alliance seems to be holding up well. For Fall 1903, we need to make sure that we keep the pressure on France and Germany where it makes sense. What specific actions do you suggest for us to make a coordinated move against Germany or France?
  From FRANCE: The coordinated action against Germany is progressing well. For Fall 1903, I suggest that you put pressure on Germany from the east while we attack from the west. Any support you can provide in that direction would be greatly appreciated.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Let us focus on our other fronts such as England for you and France for me. How about we make sure that our units do not make any aggressive moves against each other?
  From ITALY: Hello Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. The joint action against Turkey has been successful so far, with us holding strong positions. For Fall 1903, I suggest that we continue to put pressure on Turkey. Perhaps we can make a plan where your fleet in RUM supports my efforts in the Black Sea, and we try to make a move on Bulgaria or Constantinople. What do you think?
  From TURKEY: Hello Russia, indeed, no new center ownership changes occurred in the Spring 1903 Movement phase. For Fall 1903, I plan to move A BUL to SER (supported by A CON) and F BLA to AEG (for a potential move on GRE). I would appreciate if you could support A BUL to SER with F RUM and make a move on BUD if possible. Let us continue our Juggernaut alliance against Austria.

  From FRANCE: Dear Russia, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I propose a coordinated action against Germany or Turkey. If you make a move against Germany's A WAR or against Turkey's A BUL, it could help us both make strategic gains.
  From GERMANY: Dear Russia, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. What are your intentions regarding your unit in STP? I need to make sure that you do not plan to move against SWE. I propose that you focus on Turkey and Austria while I focus on France and England.
  From ITALY: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given your units in RUM and UKR, a joint action against either Austria or Turkey could be beneficial. What are your thoughts on a coordinated attack on Turkey?
  From TURKEY: Dear Russia, let us continue our Juggernaut alliance. I propose that we make a coordinated attack on Austria's remaining centers. I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. Could you support this move with F RUM? Another option is for my F BLA to move to AEG to threaten Greece. What are your thoughts on this plan?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, I agree to continue our joint action against Turkey. However, instead of moving A BUD to BUL with support from A UKR, I suggest that A SER moves to BUL with support from F RUM while A BUD holds. This plan makes more sense as it keeps BUD defended while making a move on BUL. Additionally, I plan to move F GRE to AEG so that it can be used either to attack Smyrna or support any future action on Constantinople. What do you think of this plan?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Russia, we reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance and agree to make no aggressive moves towards your A STP from our F SKA. It's important that our mutual interests in Scandinavia are respected. Do you have any plans for a coordinated action against Germany or France this round?
  From FRANCE: Let us continue our long-term alliance where I focus on Germany while you focus on Austria and Turkey. I support your plan for A MOS to move to WAR. I plan to make a coordinated move such as A PAR to BUR. Additionally, I suggest that F RUM should make a move against Turkey such as F RUM to BLA.
  From GERMANY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. I agree that making no aggressive moves between A WAR and A MOS makes sense. I hope that you make no aggressive moves against F SWE as well. Let us keep our borders peaceful and focus on our respective goals.
  From ITALY: I confirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I agree to a joint action against Turkey. I could aim for Bulgaria or Constantinople while you support me in Serbia or Greece. Let us make a plan for the Fall 1903 movement phase where I move into Bulgaria and you support me from RUM.
  From TURKEY: Thank you for reaffirming our Juggernaut alliance. I agree that A BUL should move to SER supported by A UKR and A CON. F RUM could hold or support another action such as defending against any potential counter-attacks. F BLA will move to AEG to prepare for a potential move on GRE. What do you think about this plan?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, our joint action against Turkey seems to be progressing well. I now hold BUL and Turkey has a dislodged unit in BUL that needs to retreat or disband. What should be our next steps? I suggest that we aim to capture Constantinople or Ankara. What are your plans for A UKR and F RUM in the next round?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Russia, our Northern Triple alliance has been beneficial so far. What are your plans for the next year? How can we coordinate actions against Germany or France? Let us make sure our alliance remains strong.
  From FRANCE: Our alliance should continue. I propose a joint action against Germany or Turkey. What is your current strategy and how can we support each other?
  From GERMANY: Dear Russia, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. I want to make sure that you do not make a move on SWE. I propose that you focus on the south against Turkey while I handle the threat from France. Let us respect our borders and maintain our peaceful relations.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given the current situation, a joint action against Turkey seems beneficial. What are your thoughts on this?
  From TURKEY: Our attempt to capture BUD and SER didn't succeed this round. However, Austria is weakened with only three centers remaining. Let us continue our Juggernaut alliance. For the next round, I propose that you focus on BUD while I aim for SER and GRE. For the dislodged unit in BUL, I need to retreat it to either RUM or GRE. Would you allow A BUL to retreat to RUM if that makes strategic sense for us? Another option might be to disband the unit if a strategic retreat seems unlikely to be beneficial. What is your opinion?

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, thank you for your support in capturing Bulgaria. Our joint action against Turkey is indeed progressing well. However, GRE and SER are already under my control. I suggest that our next targets should be Constantinople and Smyrna. I propose that you aim for Constantinople while I aim for Smyrna. My F AEG could move to Smyrna if supported by F ION. Let us continue our cooperation until Turkey is fully neutralized.
  From ENGLAND: Russia, our Northern Triple alliance has been very useful for us both. For the next year, I plan to continue our coordinated actions against Germany. I need your support in the north such as A STP making a move against Sweden or supporting any of our moves in the north. Additionally, A MOS could make a move against Germany's A WAR or support any other actions against Germany. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From FRANCE: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our long-term alliance where I focus on Germany while you focus on Austria and Turkey. The front against Germany is progressing well. Any additional pressure from you on Germany's eastern front would be beneficial. Perhaps a move such as A MOS to WAR could put pressure on Germany's A WAR unit. Let us continue to coordinate closely.
  From GERMANY: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I plan to keep F SWE where it is unless there is a need for a strategic move. However, any aggressive moves by you towards Sweden will be met with resistance. Let us keep our borders stable and focus on our respective goals.
  From ITALY: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I am keen on continuing our joint action against Turkey. What specific plans do you have for us to collaborate against Turkey?
  From TURKEY: Thank you for your advice. However, A CON is already in CON, so my A BUL will likely need to retreat to GRE if that is a valid option. Let us continue our alliance against Austria. I plan to make moves towards capturing GRE and SER. Your A UKR could support any move you need against Austria or Italy in the coming turns. What is your plan?

  From AUSTRIA: We should continue our joint action against Turkey. I propose that your F RUM supports my A BUL to hold against any potential Turkish attacks. Alternatively, you could support my F AEG to move to Constantinople if you make a move from the Black Sea. How does that sound?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Russia, I hope our Northern Triple alliance is still strong. Given that France has grown significantly, I believe it would be in our mutual interest to make a coordinated effort against France if necessary. What are your thoughts on this? How can we collaborate further to ensure a balanced power distribution on the board?
  From FRANCE: Dear Russia, I hope to reaffirm our non-aggression pact and propose a coordinated action against Germany. It would be ideal if you make a move from A MOS to attack WAR while I plan a move such as A PAR to BUR. This way, we can put pressure on Germany from multiple fronts.
  From GERMANY: Dear Russia, it is important that we reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I need to make sure that any potential moves in the Baltic Sea are clearly communicated so that there are no misunderstandings between us.
  From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. Given Turkey's strong position, a joint action might be necessary. I plan to support Austria in retaking Greece while making a move on Smyrna. Can you support us from the north with F RUM -> BLA and A UKR -> SEV?

Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, thank you for the congratulations on our recent gains against Turkey. I reaffirm our joint action against Turkey until they are fully neutralized. I share your concern about Italy's growing presence in the Balkans. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, a coordinated action against Italy could indeed be beneficial for our mutual interests. For now, let us make sure that Turkey does not recover. What specific actions do you propose for this round against Turkey?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Russia, it seems that France is becoming a significant threat. To keep the balance of power, I suggest a coordinated effort where you push towards central Europe while I make moves against Germany and France. How do you plan to put pressure on France and Germany this round?
  From FRANCE: Dear Russia, your reaffirmation of our long-term alliance is appreciated. I agree that any aggressive moves should be well-coordinated so that no single power becomes too dominant. My plan is to keep focusing on Germany while you could focus on Turkey or Austria. However, it would be great if you could keep an eye on Germany's eastern front as well (e.g., pressuring Warsaw). What are your plans for the coming moves?
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure you that F SWE is currently positioned for defensive purposes only. My main concern is the growing threat from France, and any support or non-aggressive moves from your part would be greatly appreciated. Let us continue our peaceful relations and potentially cooperate against any emerging threats such as France.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. A joint action against Turkey seems like a good idea. I plan to make a move on Smyrna while you could focus on the Black Sea and Bulgaria. What are your specific plans for this year?
  From TURKEY: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. To retake Bulgaria from Austria, a coordinated attack is needed. I plan to hold my position in Greece with A GRE and could use A CON to support any necessary attack on Bulgaria. F BLA could move into the Aegean Sea for a potential move on Greece if needed. A ANK could move towards Constantinople for support where necessary. I suggest that you make a move on Budapest from A UKR with support from F RUM if possible. A MOS could hold its position or support F RUM. Let us plan our moves carefully to eliminate Austria from the Balkans.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, our joint action against Turkey seems to be making progress. I now have a fleet in Smyrna and a unit in Bulgaria, although there seems to be a bounce in Bulgaria where both our unit and Turkey's unit need to resolve the situation. I plan to keep my unit in Bulgaria if possible. Could you support me in holding Bulgaria and help us capture Constantinople or Ankara? Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss our next steps.
  From ENGLAND: Russia, France has now become the dominant power with 8 supply centers. As part of the Northern Triple alliance, we should focus on curbing France's power. What are your thoughts on a coordinated effort against France this year?
  From FRANCE: Hello, our non-aggression pact still stands. A coordinated action against Germany would be beneficial, such as A MOS moving to WAR or A GAL supporting any action against Germany's eastern territories.
  From GERMANY: Russia, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I am concerned about your unit in GAL which borders my unit in WAR. I propose that you focus on Turkey and Austria while I focus on other threats. What are your intentions regarding GAL?
  From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. I propose a joint action against Turkey where your unit in RUM could support my fleet in ION to move to AEG and attack Smyrna. Alternatively, if you need support against Turkey's unit in Bulgaria, my fleet in ION could help.
  From TURKEY: Dear Russia, it seems that our coordinated efforts resulted in dislodging the Austrian army from Bulgaria. The Austrian unit needs to retreat, likely to Serbia. Let us continue our Juggernaut alliance and focus on eliminating Austria. I plan to hold and secure BUL. What are your next steps towards BUD?

  From AUSTRIA: Russia, thank you for the congratulations on capturing Bulgaria. I reaffirm our joint action against Turkey until they are neutralized. Since we already have a unit in BUL, A BUD should stay where it is or make a different move. How do you plan to use F RUM and F BLA to further our joint action against Turkey? I suggest that you aim for Constantinople or Ankara.
  From ENGLAND: Hello, I reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. A coordinated action against France should be a priority once your southern front is secure. How can we make a well-coordinated plan against France once you are ready? Any immediate moves you suggest to put pressure on France or Germany?
  From FRANCE: Russia, I reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany. A coordinated action such as your A MOS attacking WAR makes sense. I propose that you make a move such as A MOS to WAR while I make a move such as A PAR to BUR or A HOL to RUH to put pressure on Germany. Let us make a joint effort to weaken Germany's position.
  From GERMANY: Hello Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure that F SWE will not make any aggressive moves unless provoked. However, I am concerned about your units near A WAR. Can you reassure me that you will not make any aggressive moves towards Germany's territories?
  From TURKEY: Russia, I reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance. Fortunately, none of my units need to retreat this round, but I appreciate your advice and will keep CON as a safe retreat option if needed in the future. I plan to make a move on SER. How do you plan to support this, and what are your next steps against the remaining Austrian centers such as BUD?

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: RETREAT / OTHER
CRITICAL: Submit orders appropriate for this phase type (e.g., Retreat or Disband for units needing retreats). Consult rules.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

You are RUSSIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring 1904 retreats phase (S1904R), no units were dislodged in the previous moves phase, so no retreats were necessary. The board state remains the same as it was after the Spring 1904 moves phase, with no changes in unit positions or supply center ownership."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1904M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: F RUM, A STP, A MOS, A GAL
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "BUD"], ["F", "SMY"], ["A", "SER"]], "ENGLAND": [["F", "NTH"], ["F", "ENG"], ["F", "SKA"], ["A", "WAL"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "POR"], ["F", "GAS"], ["F", "BRE"], ["F", "SPA/NC"], ["A", "HOL"], ["A", "PAR"], ["F", "MAR"]], "GERMANY": [["F", "SWE"], ["A", "WAR"], ["A", "MUN"], ["A", "BUR"]], "ITALY": [["A", "ROM"], ["A", "BOH"], ["F", "ALB"], ["F", "ION"], ["A", "TYR"], ["A", "VIE"]], "RUSSIA": [["F", "RUM"], ["A", "STP"], ["A", "MOS"], ["A", "GAL"]], "TURKEY": [["F", "BLA"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "ANK"], ["A", "BUL"]]}
  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "BUL", "SER"], "ENGLAND": ["EDI", "LON", "LVP", "NWY"], "FRANCE": ["BEL", "BRE", "HOL", "KIE", "MAR", "PAR", "POR", "SPA"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "MUN", "SWE", "WAR"], "ITALY": ["NAP", "ROM", "TRI", "TUN", "VEN", "VIE"], "RUSSIA": ["MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "STP"], "TURKEY": ["ANK", "CON", "GRE", "SMY"]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Our joint action against Turkey has been successful thus far. What are your plans for A GAL and F RUM in this next phase? I suggest we continue to press on until Turkey is neutralized. I aim to keep A SER in BUL and F SMY in SMY. How can we best support each other in this round?
  From ENGLAND: Russia, France has become the dominant power on the board with 8 supply centers. It's crucial that we reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance and make a coordinated effort against France. What are your plans for the Fall 1904 moves phase?
  From FRANCE: We reaffirm our long-term alliance and plan for a coordinated action against Germany. How can we best support each other this turn? Should we make a joint move on MUN or BER?
  From GERMANY: Dear Russia, I hope our non-aggression pact is still valid. I noticed your army in GAL. Could you confirm that you have no aggressive intentions towards WAR? What are your plans for the upcoming moves phase?
  From ITALY: Let us maintain our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. Given that Turkey holds multiple supply centers, including one that borders your territory, would you be interested in a joint action against Turkey? I aim to move on Smyrna while supporting Austria to retake Greece.
  From TURKEY: Let us continue our Juggernaut alliance. I suggest that you move A GAL to BUD while I aim to secure BUL and SER. Additionally, I need to recapture SMY from the Austrian fleet. Can you support me in this endeavor?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, let us continue our joint action against Turkey until they are neutralized. I appreciate your offer for A GAL to support my A BUD to BUL. Another option could be for A BUD to support your A GAL into BUL if that makes more strategic sense. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, I am open to discussing potential actions against Italy.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Russia, I agree that France's growing power is a concern. Let us make a coordinated plan against France. Once you stabilize your southern front against Turkey, we should make a concerted effort against France. For now, any actions you can take to put pressure on France would be helpful. What are your plans for the Fall 1904 moves phase?
  From FRANCE: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and long-term alliance against Germany. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a coordinated attack on Germany. For now, any actions that check Germany's expansion should be coordinated such as you moving A MOS to WAR while I make a move such as A PAR to BUR or A HOL to KIE.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. F SWE will not make aggressive moves unless provoked. Any actions to check France's expansion would be helpful. A stable eastern border would allow me to focus on the western front.
  From ITALY: I agree that F RUM should support F ION to move to AEG and attack Smyrna. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should indeed discuss any potential actions against Austria. Let us make a coordinated effort against Turkey first.
  From TURKEY: I reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. A coordinated attack on Austria's remaining units makes sense. I suggest that you focus on attacking A BUD while I focus on A SER. Additionally, I need to recapture SMY from the Austrian fleet. Let us make a plan where you move A GAL to BUD (supported by F RUM if possible) while I move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. F BLA can be used to support any necessary actions in the Black Sea or to make a move on AEG if needed.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, it seems that our joint action against Turkey has been successful thus far. However, Turkey still has a strong presence with units in BUL, CON, and ANK. To ensure we maintain our gains, I suggest that your F RUM should support my A SER hold against any Turkish attacks from BUL. Additionally, if your F RUM is already in BLA, it could threaten BUL directly. Could you also make sure that A GAL supports A BUD hold or makes a move against Turkey if A BUL moves out of BUL? Let's keep up the pressure on Turkey until they are neutralized.
  From ENGLAND: Russia, France is now the dominant power on the board with 8 supply centers. It is important that we make a concerted effort against France this round. What are your plans for Spring 1905 moves, and how can we support each other against France?
  From FRANCE: Our long-term alliance should remain strong. I am planning to keep up the pressure on Germany. What are your plans for A GAL and F RUM? Could a coordinated action against Germany be beneficial for us?
  From GERMANY: Russia, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. My fleet in Sweden (F SWE) will not make any aggressive moves unless provoked. I would like to maintain a peaceful standoff in the Baltic Sea and make sure that our borders are respected. Can we agree to keep our units where they are for now?
  From ITALY: We need to keep up the pressure on Turkey. I plan to move F AEG to Smyrna with support from Austria. Can you support us by moving F RUM to the Black Sea to keep pressure on Constantinople?
  From TURKEY: Dear Russia, our Juggernaut alliance has been effective so far. Let us continue our coordinated attack on Austria. I propose that you move A GAL to BUD while I move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. Another part of our plan should be to recapture SMY from Austria's fleet (F SMY). What are your thoughts on this plan?

  From AUSTRIA: Russia, thank you for reaffirming our joint action against Turkey. I agree that we need to make significant moves against Turkey this round. A good plan could be that your A GAL supports my A SER move to BUL. However, it would also be crucial that your F RUM either supports A SER to BUL or makes a move against Constantinople. What do you think?
  From ENGLAND: I am well and reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. Once your southern front is secure, a coordinated action against France sounds like a solid plan. What specific moves do you have in mind for a coordinated action against France? I am ready to make a plan where F SKA and F NTH could support any necessary actions against France once you are ready.
  From FRANCE: Russia, I agree with your plan for a coordinated move against Germany. I suggest that you make the move A MOS to WAR while I make a move such as A PAR to BUR. Another option could be A HOL to KIE if Germany makes a move such as A BUR to RUH. Let us make a strategic move to weaken Germany's position.
  From GERMANY: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. F SWE will not make aggressive moves unless provoked. My plan for the next round is to keep F SWE where it is unless there is a need to defend against an attack from another power such as England or France. How can we support each other further?
  From ITALY: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I propose a joint action against Turkey where my F AEG could make a move to support an attack on Smyrna (F AEG could move to ION and then to SMY). Could your F RUM support an attack on Bulgaria? What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From TURKEY: Thank you for your continued support. I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. Your F RUM could support A BUL to hold against any potential Austrian attack from Serbia. Another priority for me is to recapture SMY from Austria. Any additional support you could provide for that would be greatly appreciated. What do you think about this plan?

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

\boxed{During the Spring 1905 moves phase, there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in Fall 1904, where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria, thus resulting in a swap of these two supply centers between the two powers, persisted through this phase.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Our joint action against Turkey has been successful so far. With Turkey's unit A CON dislodged and likely to disband, we should continue our efforts until Turkey is neutralized. I suggest that you aim for Ankara while I aim for Greece or hold Bulgaria. What are your plans for A GAL and F RUM in the next round?
  From ENGLAND: Russia, France is now the dominant power on the board with 8 supply centers. We need a coordinated effort against France to prevent them from gaining more power. How can we coordinate our actions in the coming moves to weaken France's position?
  From FRANCE: Dear Russia, our long-term alliance has been very beneficial for both of us. I want to propose a coordinated action against Germany. Given that you have an army in Galicia (A GAL) and another in Moscow (A MOS), it makes sense for you to make a move on Warsaw (A MOS to WAR or A GAL to WAR). This will help us put more pressure on Germany and make significant gains.
  From GERMANY: Dear Russia, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I am concerned about your unit in Galicia. Can you please clarify your intentions for A GAL? I hope we can continue to focus on our respective goals and avoid any conflicts.
  From ITALY: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. To address the Turkish threat, I propose a coordinated attack where Italy aims for Smyrna while supporting Austria in retaking Greece and possibly Serbia. Let us collaborate against Turkey.
  From TURKEY: Dear Russia, the Juggernaut alliance should remain our top priority. Austria still holds BUD, SER, and SMY. I plan to recapture SMY and aim for SER. How do you plan to make a move against BUD? Perhaps your F RUM could support an attack on BUL or defend against any Austrian moves.
