\boxed{The Fall 1906 movement phase (F1906M) saw significant territorial changes. England captured Belgium from France, thus gaining a new supply center while France lost one. Turkey successfully retook Constantinople from Austria while simultaneously losing Smyrna to Italy. Italy made notable gains by capturing both Smyrna from Turkey and Serbia from Austria. Consequently, England gained one new supply center (Belgium), Italy gained two (Serbia and Smyrna), and Turkey gained one (Constantinople) but also lost one (Smyrna), resulting in a net gain of one center for Turkey. France lost Belgium, and Austria lost both Constantinople and Serbia.}

--- Summary Result for Phase: S1917R ---
\boxed{During the Spring 1917 Retreat phase (S1917R), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was after the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase where Germany gained Holland from England while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw). The retreat phase did not result in any new unit movements or dislodgments, thus maintaining the status quo established in the previous movement phase.}

\boxed{During the Fall 1917 Movement phase (F1917M), several significant changes occurred in the distribution of supply centers. Germany lost Sweden to England, which now controls that center. France lost Rome to Italy, which now controls that center. However, Italy lost Venice to Austria, which now controls that center. Thus, England gained one center (Sweden), Austria gained one center (Venice), Italy gained one center (Rome) but lost one center (Venice), resulting in a net gain of zero centers for Italy if we only consider the "gained" and "lost" centers mentioned here. However, the question states that Italy "gained centers: ROM" and "lost centers: VEN," so the net change for Italy should be verified. However, the question also states that France lost one center (Rome), and Germany lost one center (Sweden).}
