Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I confirm our non-aggression pact where you focus on the Mediterranean while I focus on the Balkans. I plan to secure Serbia and possibly move towards Greece. Can you ensure that your fleet in ION does not move into the Adriatic Sea or towards Greece?
  From FRANCE: I confirm our non-aggression pact. I plan to focus on the west, which might involve a potential conflict with England or Germany. I suggest that you focus on the Mediterranean and possibly the Balkans while I handle the west. Do you have any specific plans for the Mediterranean that might require any form of indirect support or coordination from me?
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I agree that a non-aggression pact can benefit us both by allowing us to focus on our immediate neighbors. My plans for this round are to ensure peaceful borders while focusing on my immediate neighbors such as France and Russia. I hope we can maintain a peaceful border and perhaps coordinate if an opportunity arises against a common threat.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I confirm our non-aggression pact. I plan to focus on the Black Sea and Armenia while you focus on the Western Mediterranean. My plan for this round is to move A SMY to CON and A BUL to either SER or GRE. Let us keep our communication open and avoid any early conflict.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. I am open to discussing a coordinated action against Turkey. However, it's important that any plan we make ensures that our mutual non-aggression remains intact. For instance, if you could focus on supporting any potential move against Turkey from the south while I focus on the north, that might be a viable strategy. However, I need assurances that your units won't make any moves towards Tyrolia or Trieste.
  From FRANCE: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. For further cooperation in the Mediterranean, I suggest that you focus on the eastern part while I focus on the western part. Perhaps you could consider moving your F TUN to the Ionian Sea while I keep my F MAO in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean. This way, we can both expand our influence in the Mediterranean without clashing.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and am interested in a coordinated action against Turkey. I suggest that you make moves against Turkey's supply centers such as Smyrna while I make moves against Bulgaria and Constantinople. Let us make sure that Turkey does not make any gains in the Balkans.
  From TURKEY: I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A coordinated action against Austria sounds beneficial for both of us. I suggest that you move your A TYR to put pressure on Vienna or Budapest, while I focus on Serbia. I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. This way, we can make a two-pronged attack on Austria. What do you think of this plan?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. It would be mutually beneficial if you could support our actions against Turkey. One such action could be if your unit F ION supports our unit F AEG in a potential attack on Smyrna. Are you open to this?
  From FRANCE: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I am interested in a joint action against Austria if it does not conflict with our main focus on Germany. However, our main focus is on Germany. If you make a specific plan for attacking Austria, let me know what kind of support you need from France. However, any support should be carefully coordinated so that it does not weaken our position against Germany.
  From GERMANY: Our non-aggression pact remains valid. I hope we can continue to maintain peace and cooperation. Your unit in TYR makes me a bit cautious, so let us make sure our borders remain peaceful.
  From TURKEY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. Given that you are open to discussing strategic moves, do you plan any actions against Austria such as moving A TYR to VIE or BUD? Coordinating our actions could be mutually beneficial.

Given that no supply centers changed hands in the last round, I suggest that we continue to focus on our respective areas of interest. I am currently focused on the Balkans and would appreciate if you could make sure that your units do not make any aggressive moves towards my territories such as Trieste or Budapest.

  From GERMANY: Hello Italy. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and want to make sure our borders remain peaceful. I need to focus on my issues with France and Russia for now. However, if you have any plans that might require mutual coordination, such as a joint action against France or Russia, please let me know.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and our need for coordinated action against Turkey where you make moves against Smyrna while I make moves against Bulgaria and Constantinople. However, I am a bit concerned about your unit in Vienna. What are your intentions regarding Austria? We need a clear plan for Spring 1903.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I am glad that our non-aggression pact stands firm. Given that you now hold Vienna, what are your plans for the next round?

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

  From AUSTRIA: Hello, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. Given that your units are in VIE and TRI, close to my units in BUD and SER, could you share your intentions for this season? I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact and suggest a joint action against Germany. Given your unit in Vienna (A VIE), a joint action against Munich (A MUN) could be a viable plan where you move A VIE to Tyrolia (TYR) and potentially support my unit in Burgundy (A BUR) to move into Munich. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Could you let me know your intentions for A VIE and A TRI? I want to make sure that our focus remains on our mutual agreements and that any actions taken do not violate our agreement.
  From RUSSIA: Italy, let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and coordinated action against Turkey where you make moves against Smyrna while I make moves against Bulgaria and Constantinople. However, what are your plans for A VIE this turn?
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, it seems that you have made significant gains against Austria by capturing VIE and TRI. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and suggest that we continue to work together to eliminate Austria completely. I plan to move A BUL to SER and possibly A CON to support that move. Could you make a move against Austria's remaining supply center in GRE? For instance, if you move F GRE to AEG (if you have a fleet there) or make a move from A VIE or A TRI to support any of our moves against SER or GRE, that would be helpful. What are your thoughts on this plan?

Could you please provide a more specific plan for these units? I want to make sure that our non-aggression pact is respected and that we maintain open communication.
  From FRANCE: Hello, Italy. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I suggest that you focus on Austria and Turkey while I focus on Germany and England. For any support in the Mediterranean, I can keep F MAO in place to make sure our western Mediterranean remains secure and free of conflict. If you need any other support, let me know.
  From GERMANY: Hello, Italy. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. At the moment, I need to ensure that our borders remain secure. Do you have any specific plans for your units in VIE and TRI that could help us in mutual defense against Russia or Austria? It would be beneficial for us to keep our communication lines open and make sure there is no conflict in the Tyrolia region.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm the non-aggression pact until 1905. I am interested in a joint action against Turkey. F RUM could support any Italian moves from NAP to ION if Italy makes a move to support F RUM in case of a Turkish attack.
  From TURKEY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. I agree that any troop movements should be seen as part of a defensive plan unless we agree on a mutual action against another power. Are you planning any moves against Austria that might require my support? For instance, any actions on BUD or GRE? Let us keep our lines of communication open.

Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json

  From AUSTRIA: We previously agreed to a non-aggression pact until 1905 where you focus on the Mediterranean while I focus on the Balkans. However, your units in Vienna and Trieste are close to my units in Budapest and Serbia. Could you please reassure me that you intend to maintain our non-aggression pact and that these units are not a threat to me? We need to make sure that our pact is still in place and that our borders remain peaceful.
  From ENGLAND: Hello, Italy. I would like to understand your current intentions and see if there is any potential for us to work together. What are your main goals for the next round?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. It makes sense for us to keep peace in the Western Mediterranean while you focus on Austria or Turkey. What are your plans for the next round?
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I hope that you do not make any moves towards Germany's territories such as Munich or Tyrolia. Let us focus on our immediate neighbors such as France and Austria.
  From RUSSIA: Hello, it seems that no new center ownership changes occurred in the Spring 1903 Movement phase. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. How did our joint action against Turkey go? What should be our next steps for Fall 1903?
  From TURKEY: It seems you have successfully captured Vienna from Austria. Congratulations on the progress. I am reaffirming our non-aggression pact where we agreed that you focus on the Western Mediterranean while I focus on the Black Sea and Armenia. However, now that Austria only holds BUD, GRE, and SER, I would like to propose a joint action where we might divide Austria's remaining centers. I plan to make a move on Serbia or Greece. Could we coordinate such that we do not conflict and make a plan for dividing the remaining centers?

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. A joint action against Turkey makes sense. I propose that your fleet in ADR could support my move from A SER to BUL (A SER -> BUL supported by F ADR), while my fleet in GRE moves to the Aegean Sea (F GRE -> AEG) to threaten Smyrna or Constantinople. I believe this plan could help us make significant gains against Turkey this fall. However, please make sure that any troop movements are purely defensive unless a mutual action against Turkey is decided upon.
  From FRANCE: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A joint action against Austria could be beneficial. However, we need to make sure that any such action does not weaken our main focus on Germany. How do you propose we coordinate against Austria?
  From GERMANY: I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. We should make sure that our borders remain peaceful. I hope that we can continue to respect each other’s interests and keep the peace in central Europe.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and am interested in a joint action against Turkey. I could use your support in moving into Bulgaria or Constantinople while I can support your movements into Serbia or Greece. However, I need to make sure that our actions are well-coordinated.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I am indeed interested in joint actions against Austria. Given that you have units in VIE and TRI, could you make a move on BUD while I aim for SER or GRE? A coordinated attack could help us both gain a supply center from Austria.

  From AUSTRIA: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Can you confirm that your units in VIE and TRI will not make any aggressive moves against BUD or SER? Our main focus should still be on countering Turkey.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I want to confirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. If you are open to a cooperative stance in the Mediterranean, I suggest that we could make a joint action against another power such as Austria or Turkey. This would allow you to focus on the Balkans while I focus on Northern Europe.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Make sure that you do not make any aggressive moves against Germany. I propose that you focus on France and Austria while I focus on Russia and England.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905 and plan a joint action against Turkey. I suggest that you support moves into Bulgaria or Constantinople while I support you in Serbia or Greece. What are your thoughts on this plan for the Fall 1903 movement phase?
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. It seems that Austria is on the brink of elimination. How do you plan to proceed against Austria's remaining centers (BUD, GRE, SER)? I am planning to make a move on Serbia. Can we make sure that our actions are coordinated so that we do not conflict?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Our main focus is on the Balkans and Turkey such that troop movements should be seen as part of a defensive plan unless a mutual action against another power is decided. Please make sure that your units in VIE and TRI do not make any threatening moves towards BUD or SER. We need to trust each other for mutual support if another power makes an aggressive move.
  From FRANCE: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given our strong position, I am interested in coordinating actions against Germany. I plan to make a move on BUR with A PAR. Could you make a move against Austria such as A VIE to BUD or A TRI to BUD? Additionally, any cooperation in the Mediterranean should be focused on containing Turkey.
  From GERMANY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. It is important for us to make sure that our strategic positioning does not cause any misunderstandings. At the moment, France appears to be a growing power and a potential threat. Any support you can provide by making moves against France could be mutually beneficial. What are your thoughts?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A joint action against Turkey makes sense. A UKR could support any moves you make against Turkey such as A VEN -> BUL. What are your specific plans for this round?
  From TURKEY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. For the next round, I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON and A UKR (if Russia agrees). F BLA will move to AEG to prepare for a potential move on GRE. It would be helpful if you could focus on BUD or support us in taking SER or GRE if possible. What are your thoughts on this plan?

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"The Fall 1903 movement phase concluded without any centers changing ownership such that the game state remained stable with no new supply center captures."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. However, I need reassurance about the intentions for your units in TRI and BOH. Could you please clarify your plans for these units? Additionally, I suggest that we continue our joint action against Turkey where you could support our efforts in the Balkans or help in capturing Constantinople or Smyrna. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I see that you have a significant military presence and six supply centers. What are your intentions for the next year? Is there potential for us to cooperate against France or Germany?
  From FRANCE: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 is still important. I see that you have a strong position in the Balkans. Perhaps we could cooperate against Austria or Turkey if that aligns with your plans.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. I am concerned about your unit in A TYR which could potentially threaten MUN. I request that you do not make a move on MUN and instead focus on other regions such as Austria or Turkey. Let us maintain our peaceful relations.
  From RUSSIA: ITALY, I see that you have units in TRI and ALB. What are your intentions in the Balkans? Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and continue our joint action against Turkey. What is your plan for the next moves against Turkey?
  From TURKEY: The situation with Austria is still precarious for them. What are your plans for Austria's remaining centers such as BUD and GRE? I aim to focus on SER and GRE. It would make sense for us to coordinate so that you aim for BUD while I aim for SER and GRE. Do you agree with this plan for the next round? We need to make sure that our non-aggression pact holds firm.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I am indeed interested in a joint action against Turkey. It seems that Turkey is a mutual threat. I suggest that your F ION could support my F AEG for a potential move to Smyrna or support an attack on Constantinople. Let us work together to eliminate the Turkish threat.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I am indeed interested in a joint action against Germany. However, it is important that we make sure our actions are well-coordinated. I plan to make a move such as A PAR to BUR. Could you make a move such as A BOH to MUN to put pressure on Germany from the south? However, make sure that our non-aggression pact remains intact.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. To strengthen our alliance, I am interested in joint actions against France or Russia. However, it is important that we make sure there are no aggressive moves towards my territories such as Munich or Burgundy. What specific joint actions do you have in mind?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and am willing to consider a joint action against Turkey. I propose that you aim for Greece and Serbia while I aim for Constantinople and Ankara. Once Turkey is sufficiently weakened, a joint action against Austria could be considered where you make a move from the west while I make a move from the east. Let us make sure our cooperation is fruitful.
  From TURKEY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact as well. I am open to joint action against Austria. My A BUL was dislodged and will likely retreat to GRE. I plan to make moves towards capturing GRE and possibly SER next round. Meanwhile, could you aim for BUD to divide Austria's remaining centers between us?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I need reassurance regarding your A TRI and A TYR units close to my centers. Should we also consider a joint action against Turkey or perhaps a new threat, such as France, who now has 9 supply centers?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, France has grown very strong and now holds 8 supply centers. This makes them a significant threat to all of us. I am interested in forming an alliance with you to curb France's expansion. What are your thoughts on this? How can we collaborate to make a concerted effort against France?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I wish to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. While I focus on Germany, I suggest that you make a move against Austria or Turkey. This could help us both to expand our influence while keeping our borders peaceful.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I want to make sure that our non-aggression pact stands strong. However, I need to verify your intentions regarding A TYR which borders A MUN. Can you assure me that you are not planning any aggressive moves against Munich?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Given Turkey's weakened state, what are your plans in the Balkans? Perhaps a joint action against Turkey could be mutually beneficial.

Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Your plan to work together against Turkey makes sense. However, instead of moving A BUD to SER, I think it might be more strategic for A BUD to stay in BUD for now to provide a defensive position against any potential threats. However, if you could support A BUL to hold or make a move on Greece, that could be a more direct action against Turkey. For the fleet, I suggest that F ION could support F AEG to move to SMY or CON. What do you think about this plan?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I appreciate your reaffirmation of the non-aggression pact until 1905. Given that France is growing stronger, I am open to future cooperation against France once your situation with Turkey is stabilized. Let us keep in touch and plan for a future alliance against France.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I support your focus on Turkey and would be open to providing support if needed. However, if you are also open to a coordinated action against Germany, I would be interested in discussing a plan where we pressure Germany from both the west (France) and the south (Italy). What are your thoughts on this?
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I understand that A TYR is there for defensive purposes only and appreciate your peaceful intentions. Given that France has grown very strong, would you consider a joint action against France? Any support from your part could help us all.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I agree to support a joint action against Turkey where A UKR could make a move to support SEV if necessary while F RUM should remain in RUM to hold against any Turkish moves. Let us make a coordinated effort against Turkey.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I am glad that you reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. To address your concerns about a defined border, I propose that Turkey agrees not to move into Albania or the Ionian Sea while Italy agrees not to make any moves into Greece or the Aegean Sea. Thus, Turkey will focus on Bulgaria and Serbia while Italy focuses on the Western Mediterranean and Central Europe. Does this sound agreeable? Furthermore, a joint effort against Austria could still be beneficial where you aim for Budapest while we aim for Bulgaria and Serbia.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My units are primarily focused on neutralizing Turkey. I need reassurance that your units in VIE and TYR are not intended for any aggressive moves against me. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss our next steps.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, France now has 8 supply centers and is the most powerful player on the board. We need to curb their expansion. Would you be interested in an alliance against France? What plans do you have to counter their dominance?
  From FRANCE: Hello, our non-aggression pact until 1905 should still hold. We suggest that you focus on Austria or Turkey. If A BOH could support us in a coordinated action against Germany, that would be beneficial for us both.
  From GERMANY: Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I am concerned about your units in BOH and TYR which border MUN. What are your intentions? I suggest that you focus on France and Austria while I focus on Russia.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. It seems that we have dislodged Austria from Bulgaria and plan to hold it securely. Our defined borders still stand where Turkey avoids Albania and ION while Italy avoids GRE and AEG. How do you plan to proceed against Austria's remaining centers like BUD?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. However, it seems there is a misunderstanding: Turkey no longer has a unit in Bulgaria. We have successfully captured BUL and have a unit stationed there. To continue our joint action against Turkey, I suggest that you make a move on Smyrna while I hold BUL and potentially make a move towards Greece or Constantinople. How do you see this plan?
  From ENGLAND: Hello, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Once your situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to cooperating against France. Any support against France would be appreciated if it aligns with my plans. Please keep me informed about your progress in the south.
  From FRANCE: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I support your focus on Turkey this round. However, if you are open to a joint action against Austria, I suggest that we make a coordinated attack on Austria's supply centers such as BUD or SER. For instance, my A MAR could move to PIE and support your A TYR to VEN if you make a move on BUD. What do you think?
  From GERMANY: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905 and understand that A TYR is for defensive purposes. However, France has grown too powerful with 8 supply centers. It might be beneficial for us to keep an eye on France's growing power and consider a joint effort against France if necessary.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I agree to a joint action against Turkey where F RUM could support F ION to move to AEG and attack Smyrna. Alternatively, if you could support my actions against Turkey's unit in Bulgaria, that would be helpful.
  From TURKEY: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I agree that focusing on Austria makes sense. Since we need to make our borders secure, I plan to make no aggressive moves against Italy. However, Austria still has supply centers in BUD and SER. Do you plan to make a move on BUD? I am considering a move on SER. Let us make sure that our borders remain secure and that we continue to work to eliminate any remaining Austrian influence.

Do you have any plans against Turkey where we could coordinate? For instance, if you have any units that could support us in the region or make a move against Turkey's remaining units.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, France has become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. Given that you have 6 supply centers, it might be in our mutual interest to form an alliance against France. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb France's expansion?
  From FRANCE: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 still stands. How should we cooperate further? Should we make a joint action against Austria or Turkey?
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I hope our non-aggression pact is still in place. I noticed your army in TYR. Could you confirm that you have no aggressive intentions towards MUN? What are your plans for the upcoming moves phase?
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. F RUM could support F ION to move to AEG and attack Smyrna. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss any potential actions against Austria.
  From TURKEY: Let us continue our non-aggression pact until 1905. I plan to focus on BUL and SER while you might want to focus on BUD. Let us make sure our actions are coordinated so that we can effectively dismantle Austria.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. For a joint action against Turkey, I already have a fleet in Smyrna (F SMY), so your proposal to make a move on Smyrna might need a bit of a rethink. Instead, I propose that you support my A SER to GRE while I make a move on Constantinople with my F SMY. Another option could be that you support F SMY to CON if you need to make a move on Smyrna yourself. However, it makes more sense for us to work together where I aim for Greece and Constantinople while you make a move on Smyrna or support me in those areas.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I agree that once you resolve your situation with Turkey, a joint plan against France would be beneficial. France has become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. Let us make a plan to curb France's expansion once you are ready. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan against France?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I agree to continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. I support your focus on resolving the Turkey situation. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss a joint plan against Germany or Austria.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. I understand that your A TYR unit is for defensive purposes. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to discussing future strategic plans such as a potential joint action against Austria or France.
  From RUSSIA: We agree to maintain our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. A joint action against Turkey sounds good. F RUM could support F ION to move to AEG and attack Smyrna. Let us make a coordinated effort to neutralize Turkey.
  From TURKEY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. My main focus is on eliminating Austria and recapturing SMY from the Austrian fleet. I have no aggressive intentions towards you. However, I need to make moves against Austria such as targeting A BUD and A SER. I hope you understand that any actions I take against Austria should not be seen as a threat to Italy. Let us continue to work together to ensure a stable Balkans.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, we have a non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. I hope we can respect this agreement until the current year ends. However, what are your intentions for your units in VIE and TRI? We need to make sure that our borders remain peaceful. I suggest that you focus on other fronts such as France or Germany while we focus on neutralizing Turkey.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, France has now become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. We need to make a coordinated plan to curb their expansion. How can we work together against France this round? What are your plans for Spring 1905 moves?
  From FRANCE: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 should still hold. However, I am interested in your plans for A BOH and A TYR. Perhaps a coordinated action against Germany could be beneficial for both of us.
  From GERMANY: Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, the presence of your A TYR and A BOH makes me concerned about potential threats to Munich. Can you provide reassurance that you have no aggressive intentions towards my home centers? Let us make sure that our borders are respected.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I hope you are well. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Given the current situation, I propose a joint action against Turkey where your F AEG could make a move to support an attack on Smyrna or Bulgaria. What are your plans for the next round, and how can I support you further?
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I hope our non-aggression pact until 1905 still stands. Given that Austria still holds BUD, SER, and SMY, I propose that we continue our joint efforts against Austria. I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON and aim to recapture SMY. What are your plans for this round? Do you intend to make any moves against BUD or SER?

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1905M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Italy, I appreciate your proposal to continue our joint action against Turkey. However, I already hold Smyrna (F SMY), so supporting your F AEG to move to Smyrna seems incorrect. Instead, I propose that your F AEG supports my F SMY to move to CON or that your F AEG itself moves to CON while I support my A SER to move to BUL. Another option could be that your F AEG supports a potential A SER move to GRE if that makes strategic sense for us. What do you think?
  From ENGLAND: I understand that your main focus is on resolving the situation with Turkey for now. Once that is done, I am eager for future cooperation against France. Curbing France's power is a priority once you are ready to join the effort. Let us keep in touch.
  From FRANCE: Italy, I acknowledge the reaffirmation of our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. Our main focus is on the situation with Germany. I support your focus on Turkey and am willing to cooperate where our interests align. Please keep me informed of your actions against Turkey as it could help us both achieve our goals.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I acknowledge your defensive stance and reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I need to make sure that A TYR does not make any aggressive moves towards MUN. Let us keep our borders secure while you focus on the situation in the south against Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I agree that we should keep up the pressure on Turkey. F RUM could move to BLA to keep pressure on Constantinople. Make sure that you and Austria coordinate well so that F AEG can successfully move to Smyrna with support from Austria. A GAL could also be used to make a move against Turkey if needed.
  From TURKEY: I appreciate the reaffirmation of our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. However, could you clarify what you mean by 'strategic necessity' driving your current actions? It's important for us to maintain clear communication to avoid any misunderstandings. How can we better support each other while keeping our borders secure?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905 has been beneficial for both of us. I suggest that you aim for holding Greece and supporting any moves against Turkey if necessary. What are your plans for A VIE and A TYR?
  From ENGLAND: Italy, France has become a major threat with 8 supply centers. Given that you have 6 supply centers, it might be in our mutual interest to form an alliance against France. What are your plans for the next moves and how can we work together to curb France's expansion?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. It seems that you are making good progress in the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean. I suggest that you continue to focus on Austria or Turkey. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful and that we do not make any moves against each other.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I am concerned about your unit in Tyrolia. Can you please clarify your intentions for A TYR? I hope we can continue to focus on our respective goals and avoid any conflicts.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Italy, I hope our non-aggression pact until 1905 still holds. I need to make sure that your unit in GRE does not make any aggressive moves against RUM. Let us make a joint action against Turkey.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I wish to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. Could you please clarify what you meant by 'strategic necessity' in a previous round? I hope we can continue our peaceful relations until the end of 1905 and discuss any potential future collaboration once that period ends.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. However, it seems there is a misunderstanding. Smyrna is currently under Austrian control. I suggest that Italy should aim for another Turkish supply center such as Ankara or support us in retaking Bulgaria or Greece. Let us plan a coordinated attack against Turkey where you could aim for Ankara while I aim for Constantinople.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, thank you for your message. Once your situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to future cooperation against France or Germany. Keeping in touch and making a coordinated plan could make a significant impact. Let us stay in contact.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I acknowledge your reaffirmation of our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. Let us maintain our peaceful relations until that time. Once the pact expires, we should initiate a new round of negotiations to discuss our future plans and any potential cooperation.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. I am glad that A TYR is for defensive purposes only. Let us continue our peaceful relations.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. A coordinated attack against Turkey makes sense where you aim for Smyrna while I make sure that Turkey is neutralized. However, once Turkey is handled, we need to make sure that no single power dominates the board, so a balanced power distribution should be our long-term goal.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. However, I am a bit concerned about your mention of 'strategic moves that may seem aggressive.' Could you please clarify what you mean by this? I aim to maintain a peaceful relationship until the end of 1905 and would like to understand your plans better.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. Given that Turkey still holds Bulgaria and Greece, I propose that your F AEG should support my F CON to hold or make a move against Ankara or BLA. Additionally, could your F GRE support my A BUL to hold or make a move against Constantinople if necessary? Let us continue our joint action against Turkey until they are neutralized.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, you are in a strong position with 6 supply centers. However, France's 8 supply centers make them a significant threat. Once you resolve your situation with Turkey, it would be in our mutual interest to form a joint plan to curb France's expansion. What are your thoughts?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I hope this message finds you well. I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. Given our current positions, I suggest a joint action against Germany where you could make a move on MUN while I make a move on BUR. Alternatively, we could continue our focus on Austria and Turkey. Let us work together to make a strategic move that benefits us both.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. However, I am concerned about your unit in BOH which could threaten MUN and BUR. To avoid any conflict, I propose that you move A BOH to another location such as GAL or SIL so that I can keep A BUR where it is or move it to another strategic location such as MUN for defense.
  From RUSSIA: Let's reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of this year. It seems that our joint action against Turkey is making progress. What are your plans for the next round? How can we continue to support each other against Turkey and potentially against Austria?
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. However, I need to ask about your intentions for your fleets in AEG and GRE. Given that Austria has captured BUL and CON from us, any support you can provide in recapturing these territories would be greatly appreciated. Please let us know your plans and if there is any way we can work together against Austria.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, thank you for your continued cooperation. However, Smyrna is already under Austrian control. We need to focus on retaking Greece or perhaps you should aim for Ankara. Another option could be for your F AEG to support us in holding Constantinople against a potential Turkish counter-attack.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I acknowledge your message and am willing to cooperate against France once your situation with Turkey is resolved. Let us keep in touch and make a plan once you are in a more stable position.
  From FRANCE: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905 as well. Let us keep peace on our borders and make sure that our units do not make any threatening moves against each other. My units in MAR and SPA should remain in a defensive position unless there is an agreement for a joint action against another common threat such as Austria or Turkey.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. A BUR is mainly for defensive purposes. Thank you for the reminder that A TYR is for defensive purposes only.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that we need to keep up the pressure on Turkey. You should aim for Smyrna while supporting Austria in retaking Greece. F RUM could support a move from AEG to Smyrna if feasible. Let us make a coordinated effort to push Turkey out of the Balkans.
  From TURKEY: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. However, I need to know your intentions regarding your fleets in AEG and GRE. It is important that we maintain a clear understanding of our borders and avoid any aggressive moves against each other's supply centers such as CON or BUL.

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1905 moves phase (F1905M), there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation thus remains consistent with the state established in the Spring 1905 retreats phase (S1905R), where Turkey had captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria. The game state thus continues to reflect the same distribution of supply centers as previously described.}

Phase: F1905R, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1905 moves phase (F1905M), there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation thus remains consistent with the state established in the Spring 1905 retreats phase (S1905R), where Turkey had captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria. The game state thus continues to reflect the same distribution of supply centers as previously described.}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1905R

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hi, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905 is almost ending. What are your plans for your units in VIE and TRI? We need to make sure that our focus remains on Turkey. Can we make a coordinated action against Turkey where your F AEG supports any of our moves against BLA or Smyrna if necessary?
  From ENGLAND: Italy, France has become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. Given that you have 6 supply centers, it might be in our mutual interest to form an alliance against France. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb France's expansion once you resolve your situation with Turkey?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905 has been a great success. As we approach the end of the year, I would like to discuss what our future relations should be. I believe that continuing our non-aggression pact could be beneficial for both of us. Additionally, I suggest that we could make a joint plan against Austria or Turkey. What are your thoughts on this?
  From GERMANY: Italy, you are the second largest power with 6 supply centers. We should reaffirm our non-aggression pact and potentially cooperate against the growing power of France.
  From RUSSIA: Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905 still stands. What are your plans for the future, particularly regarding Turkey and Austria?
  From TURKEY: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. However, Austria now holds BUL, CON, and BUD. What are your intentions for the next moves? Is there any way we can cooperate to put more pressure on Austria? It seems that the next round could be a build phase if any supply center changes.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding. Smyrna is a supply center owned by Austria, but there is a Turkish army in Smyrna (A SMY). Thus, our goal should be to dislodge the Turkish army from Smyrna and secure the supply center. I propose that your fleet in AEG should support an attack on Smyrna (i.e., support an Austrian unit to move into Smyrna or directly attack Smyrna if feasible). Additionally, your fleet in GRE could support an Austrian unit to retake Greece if possible. What are your plans for your units in BOH and TYR?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I acknowledge your message and am willing to cooperate against France once your situation with Turkey is resolved. A joint plan against France could be beneficial once you are ready. Please let me know once you have resolved the situation with Turkey so that we can make a more specific plan.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I am glad to hear that A TYR is for defensive purposes only. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. My main focus currently is on dealing with the threat posed by France.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that our non-aggression pact should remain until the end of 1905. I am open to a joint action against Turkey where you aim for Smyrna while supporting Austria in retaking Greece. Let us make a plan for a coordinated attack on Turkey.
  From TURKEY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. Given that Austria currently holds BUL and CON, which I need to recapture, it is crucial that your fleets in AEG and GRE do not make any moves that could be interpreted as aggressive. Can we agree that you will not move F AEG to SMY or make any other moves that might threaten my units or supply centers?

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Winter 1905 adjustment phase (W1905A), no supply centers changed ownership. Based on the previous phase, Germany, England, Austria, and Italy were able to build one unit each due to each gaining a new supply center. Conversely, France had to disband two units due to losing Holland and Kiel, while Turkey needed to disband one unit after a net loss of one supply center.}

  From AUSTRIA: The non-aggression pact we had until the end of 1905 has now expired. I propose that we renew it for another year until the end of 1906. Your units in TRI, BOH, and TYR make me a bit uneasy. Can we agree to keep our borders peaceful for another year while we both focus on other threats such as Germany and Turkey?
  From FRANCE: Hello, Italy. Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905 has now expired. I propose that we renew a non-aggression pact for 1906. It makes sense for us to focus on different fronts; perhaps you could focus on Austria or Turkey while I focus on Germany. What do you think?
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I hope that your unit in BOH does not make any aggressive moves against Germany. How do you see our cooperation evolving this round?
  From RUSSIA: Italy, our non-aggression pact until 1905 has expired. I propose that we renew our non-aggression pact and make a joint action against Turkey. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a coordinated action against Austria.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, our non-aggression pact lasted until the end of 1905. As we are now in 1906, I would like to discuss extending this pact or renegotiating terms. It is important that we maintain a peaceful border so that we can both focus on other threats. What are your intentions for the coming year?

  From AUSTRIA: Greetings, Italy. I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding. Smyrna is currently held by Turkey (unit A SMY is there), and it makes sense for you to aim for Smyrna while I aim for Ankara. However, Serbia is already an Austrian supply center (though no unit is there currently), and Greece is your supply center where you have a unit (F GRE). Thus, a more logical plan might be for you to aim for Smyrna while I aim for Ankara or support you in taking Smyrna. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From ENGLAND: Greetings, Italy. I appreciate your openness to future cooperation against France or Germany once the situation with Turkey is resolved. Let us keep communication lines open and make a plan once your situation stabilizes.
  From FRANCE: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. It makes sense for us both to focus on other fronts. Once you have resolved the situation with Turkey, I am open to discussing any joint plans for future turns, possibly against Germany.
  From GERMANY: Greetings, Italy. We agree to extend the non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. However, we are concerned about your unit in BOH which seems close to MUN. We hope that you keep A BOH from making any aggressive moves against MUN. Let us maintain our peaceful coexistence.
  From RUSSIA: Greetings, Italy. I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. I am also open to continuing our joint action against Turkey where you aim to take Smyrna while supporting Austria in retaking Greece and possibly Serbia. However, once Turkey is neutralized, I hope that we can make a new agreement to ensure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From TURKEY: Italy, I accept your proposal to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. It is in our mutual interest to avoid conflict and focus on other threats. However, I need assurance that your fleets in AEG and GRE will not make any aggressive moves against my units or supply centers. Let us work together to maintain peace on our borders.

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1906 movement phase (S1906M), no supply centers changed ownership, thus maintaining the status quo in terms of territorial gains and losses for all powers involved. The distribution of supply centers remained the same as at the end of the Winter 1905 adjustment phase, where Germany, England, Austria, and Italy had each gained a new supply center previously, while France had lost two centers and Turkey had lost one. The round of military maneuvers did not result in any new captures or losses for any power.}

  From AUSTRIA: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. I plan to make a move against Turkey this round (A BUL -> SMY). Could you make sure that your units in VIE and TRI do not make any aggressive moves against me? Additionally, if you are not planning to make a move on Smyrna yourself, could you support my A BUL -> SMY move with your F AEG?
  From ENGLAND: Italy, you have become the leading power with 7 supply centers. However, France still holds a fleet in the English Channel which is a direct threat to us. What are your intentions and would you be interested in a joint plan against France or Germany?
  From FRANCE: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. Given that you have a unit in BOH, it might be a good opportunity for us to make a coordinated move against Germany. If you make a move on MUN, we can make a move on BUR or RUH.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Please make sure that A BOH does not make any aggressive moves towards MUN. Let us keep our borders peaceful and focus on our respective goals.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I propose renewing our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906 and making a joint action against Turkey where you aim for Smyrna while I make moves against Bulgaria and Constantinople.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. Given your fleets in AEG and GRE, I need assurance that you do not plan any aggressive moves against my supply centers in SMY or ANK. Do you plan to make any moves against Austria's remaining centers such as BUD or SER?

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, we agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. However, we should make sure that our actions against Turkey are well-coordinated. We aim to capture Smyrna while you could aim for Ankara or support us in retaking Greece if necessary. Let us make sure that our units do not conflict and that we make coordinated moves against Turkey.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, I agree to continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. Once your situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to future cooperation against France or Germany. However, given that you now have 7 supply centers, it might be important to make sure that our actions are well-coordinated so that no single power becomes too dominant.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I agree to continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. I support your focus on resolving the situation with Turkey. Once that is done, I am open to discussing future plans.
  From GERMANY: I agree to continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. I understand that your unit in BOH is for defensive purposes. My main focus is on resolving the situation with France and Russia.
  From RUSSIA: I agree to continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. I am interested in joining your joint action against Turkey. Let us make a coordinated effort to eliminate Turkey.
  From TURKEY: We agree to continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. However, any aggressive moves such as moving your fleets in AEG or GRE towards SMY or ANK would be seen as a breach of the pact. We hope for a peaceful resolution and a clear understanding of our borders.

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Winter 1906 adjustments phase (W1906A) saw no changes in the ownership of supply centers. The results from the Fall 1906 movement phase thus remained in effect, where England gained Belgium from France, Turkey reclaimed Constantinople from Austria while losing Smyrna to Italy, and Italy captured Smyrna from Turkey and Serbia from Austria. Consequently, England's total supply centers increased by one, Italy gained two new centers, Turkey had a net gain of one center, while France lost one center and Austria lost two centers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Winter 1906 adjustments phase (W1906A) saw no changes in the ownership of supply centers. The results from the Fall 1906 movement phase thus remained in effect, where England gained Belgium from France, Turkey reclaimed Constantinople from Austria while losing Smyrna to Italy, and Italy captured Smyrna from Turkey and Serbia from Austria. Consequently, England's total supply centers increased by one, Italy gained two new centers, Turkey had a net gain of one center, while France lost one center and Austria lost two centers.}

  From AUSTRIA: It seems that Italy has made significant gains and is now the strongest power on the board. Given our history of non-aggression until the end of 1906, could we extend this agreement until the end of 1907? We believe that a continued non-aggression pact could be beneficial for us both while we focus on other mutual threats such as Turkey.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, you have become the largest power on the board with 9 units and 9 supply centers. What are your intentions for the Spring 1907 moves phase? Is there a possibility for us to cooperate against Germany or France?
  From FRANCE: Hello, Italy. Our non-aggression pact was extended until the end of 1906. I would like to extend this pact for the year 1907. What are your thoughts on this? Additionally, I would like to make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From GERMANY: Hello, Italy. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I am a bit concerned about your army in Bohemia which is close to Munich. Can you confirm that your intentions are peaceful towards Munich and that Bohemia is for defensive purposes only?
  From RUSSIA: Let us renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. However, your growing power makes it necessary for us to make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, our non-aggression pact has expired at the end of 1906. I propose that we renew this pact until the end of 1907. However, I need to address the issue of Smyrna (SMY), which was captured by your forces. I would like to negotiate a peaceful resolution where you withdraw your fleet from SMY so that I can recapture it. This would help us maintain a peaceful and cooperative relationship. What are your thoughts on this proposal?

        "arguments": {
            "thought": "Analysis: Based on the current game state and the received messages, it seems that most powers are interested in renewing non-aggression pacts until the end of 1907. 

1. **Austria** suggests extending our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 while focusing on mutual threats like Turkey.
2. **England** acknowledges that Italy is now the largest power on the board and inquires about Italy's intentions for Spring 1907 moves, proposing a potential cooperation against Germany or France.
3. **France** wants to extend the non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 and ensure peaceful borders.
4. **Germany** reaffirms a non-aggression pact but expresses concern about Italy's army in Bohemia near Munich.
5. **Russia** wants to renew the non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 while ensuring that borders remain peaceful.
6. **Turkey** proposes renewing the non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 but also demands that Italy withdraws its fleet from Smyrna so that Turkey can recapture it.

Based on this, my plan is as follows:
   - **Austria**: Agree to extend the non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 and suggest a joint action against Turkey where Italy maintains control of Smyrna while possibly supporting Austria in retaking Bulgaria or another target.
   - **England**: Express willingness to cooperate against Germany or France once the situation with Turkey is resolved. Given that Italy is now the largest power on the board, it’s important to maintain a friendly stance with England while focusing on consolidating in the south.
   - **France**: Agree to extend the non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 and ensure that our borders remain peaceful. However, be cautious of any potential French aggression or alliance with England against us.
   - **Germany**: Reassure Germany that the army in Bohemia is for defensive purposes only and affirm that our intentions are peaceful towards Munich.
   - **Russia**: Agree to renew the non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 and ensure that our borders remain peaceful. However, a joint action against Turkey could be a point of cooperation.
   - **Turkey**: Agree to renew the non-aggression pact until the end of 1907, but firmly state that Smyrna is now under Italian control. However, it might be worth negotiating an agreement where Turkey focuses on another target such as Bulgaria or Greece (which could be a false promise).

Plan for this round: 
   - Send a message to Austria agreeing to extend the non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 and suggest a joint action against Turkey where Italy keeps Smyrna while supporting Austria in retaking Bulgaria.
   - Send a message to England expressing willingness to cooperate against Germany or France once the situation with Turkey is stabilized.
   - Send a message to France agreeing to extend the non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 and reaffirming peaceful borders.
   - Send a message to Germany reassuring them that the army in Bohemia is for defensive purposes only.
   - Send a message to Russia agreeing to renew the non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 and suggesting a joint action against Turkey where Italy keeps Smyrna.
   - Send a message to Turkey agreeing to renew the non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 but making it clear that Smyrna is important to Italy and should remain under our control. Suggest that Turkey could focus on another target such as Bulgaria or Greece."

  From AUSTRIA: Hello, Italy. I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. I support a joint action against Turkey where you aim to keep Smyrna while I aim to retake Serbia and possibly Greece. However, given my precarious position, can you ensure that your units in Serbia, Bohemia, and Vienna will not make any aggressive moves towards my remaining centers in Budapest and Bulgaria?
  From ENGLAND: Hello, Italy. I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I'm open to future cooperation against France or Germany. However, it makes sense for us to keep an eye on Italy's movements as well. What are your plans for this round?
  From FRANCE: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. We aim to maintain peace and cooperation on our borders.
  From GERMANY: To ITALY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. It makes sense for us both to maintain peace on our borders while focusing on other regions. I trust that your army in BOH is for defensive purposes only.
  From RUSSIA: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 and make a joint action against Turkey until it is neutralized. However, once Turkey is out, it makes sense to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant on the board.

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Spring 1907 movement phase (S1907M) followed a Winter 1906 adjustments phase that saw no changes in supply center ownership. However, during the Fall 1906 phase, England had captured Belgium from France, Italy had taken Smyrna from Turkey and Serbia from Austria, while Turkey had reclaimed Constantinople from Austria. This resulted in England gaining one additional supply center, Italy gaining two, Turkey having a net gain of one, while France lost one and Austria lost two supply centers. The Spring 1907 movement phase itself did not result in any changes in ownership of supply centers, so the distribution of supply centers remained as it was after the Winter 1906 adjustments phase.}

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. However, with Italy holding units in VIE and SER which are close to BUD and BUL, I need assurance that you will not make any aggressive moves against our remaining units in BUD or BUL.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, congratulations on your recent gains. However, you now have a significant lead with 9 supply centers. What are your intentions for the next phase? Perhaps we could make a joint plan against another power such as France or Germany.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, it seems that our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906 has been mutually beneficial. I suggest that we extend this non-aggression pact for the year 1907. Additionally, if there are any common enemies such as Germany that we could jointly act against, I am open to discussing such plans.
  From GERMANY: Hello Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given your strong position in the Balkans and Austria's weakened state, what are your plans for the next round? We need to make sure that our borders remain secure.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. We need to make a joint action against Turkey. Once Turkey is neutralized, we need to make a plan to address the balance of power in the Balkans. What are your thoughts on a future non-aggression pact once Turkey is neutralized?
  From TURKEY: Italy, our non-aggression pact has expired. However, I am open to discussing a new one if you are willing to withdraw your fleets from AEG and SMY. What are your intentions?

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Italy, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. However, I am already in control of Bulgaria (A BUL is in BUL), so a joint action against Turkey where I aim for Bulgaria seems redundant. Instead, I could aim for Constantinople while you support from Smyrna and the Aegean Sea. What do you think?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I acknowledge your message and am willing to cooperate against France once your situation with Turkey is resolved. However, I need to make sure that you do not make any aggressive moves against my home centers such as LON or LVP. What specific plans do you have for future cooperation against France or Germany?
  From FRANCE: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. Once the Turkey situation is resolved, I am open to discussing potential actions against Germany or England. It makes sense for us to keep our borders secure while focusing on other threats.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. However, I need a clear signal that your unit in BOH is purely defensive and should not be used against Germany. What are your intentions towards other regions like Austria and Russia?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. However, I need to focus on other threats such as Germany for this round. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. However, I need some assurance that your fleets in AEG, GRE, and SMY will not make any aggressive moves towards my territories. I hope we can maintain peace and stability in the East.

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Fall 1907 movement phase did not result in any changes in the ownership of supply centers among the remaining powers (England, Italy, Turkey, France, and Austria). Therefore, the distribution of supply centers remained as follows: England with 12 centers, Italy with 7, Turkey with 3, France with 3, and Austria with 1 center until the next phase, which would be the Winter 1907 adjustments phase where any new captures from the Fall 1907 movement phase would be processed (which in this case, there were none).}

Phase: F1907R, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Fall 1907 movement phase did not result in any changes in the ownership of supply centers among the remaining powers (England, Italy, Turkey, France, and Austria). Therefore, the distribution of supply centers remained as follows: England with 12 centers, Italy with 7, Turkey with 3, France with 3, and Austria with 1 center until the next phase, which would be the Winter 1907 adjustments phase where any new captures from the Fall 1907 movement phase would be processed (which in this case, there were none).}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. I hope that you will not make any aggressive moves against BUD or BUL. Given our mutual interests, what are your plans for the next phase?
  From ENGLAND: Italy, your expansion has been impressive. However, it seems that a lot of powers are now concerned about your dominant position. What are your plans for the next season? Do you intend to focus on France or Germany?
  From FRANCE: Hello, Italy. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. It is important that our borders remain peaceful. Let us make sure that we do not make any aggressive moves against each other.
  From GERMANY: Hello, Italy. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. It is important that we do not make any aggressive moves against each other. What are your plans for the next round?
  From RUSSIA: Hello, Italy. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. However, once the pact expires, I propose that we make a joint action against England, who seems to be the most significant threat. What are your plans for the next round?
  From TURKEY: To Italy, it seems that you have made significant gains. However, Turkey is now in a very precarious position. I would like to negotiate a non-aggression pact or a truce until a more favorable position can be established for us both. What do you think about this?

However, it seems that you currently hold both Greece and Serbia. Could you please provide a more specific plan on how you intend to support us in retaking these territories?
  From ENGLAND: Hello, Italy. It's good to hear that the situation with Turkey is progressing well. Once it is resolved, I am open to future cooperation against France. Let us make a plan for a joint effort against France once Turkey is no longer a threat.
  From FRANCE: I agree that we should maintain our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. Once you resolve the situation with Turkey, I am willing to support you against other potential threats. However, I need to make some strategic moves to secure my own position.
  From GERMANY: I understand that your army in Bohemia is for defensive purposes. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. However, it is important that we both respect each other's borders and avoid any misunderstandings.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Italy, I agree to continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. Our joint action against Turkey seems to be effective and I aim for continued cooperation until Turkey is on the defensive. However, once Turkey is neutralized, what are your plans for future actions?
  From TURKEY: Hello Italy, I acknowledge that our non-aggression pact is still valid until the end of 1907. However, I need to make it clear that the presence of your fleet in AEG and your fleet in Smyrna makes me uneasy. I need to make sure that once the non-aggression pact ends, we need a new agreement where I need to regain control of Smyrna.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Italy, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 has now expired. I propose that we extend this non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. Given that you have a unit in BOH, which could be seen as a threat to BUD or VIE, could you please clarify your intentions for that unit? I am open to discussing a joint action against another power if that is of interest to you.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, congratulations on your current position as the most dominant power with 7 supply centers. What are your intentions for the upcoming moves? Given the current game state, it seems that a peaceful coexistence might be beneficial for both of us. What are your plans for this year?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I hope this message finds you well. Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 has been beneficial for both of us. I would like to extend this non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. Can we agree to continue our peaceful relations and make sure that your A BOH does not make any aggressive moves that could indirectly threaten my A PAR?
  From GERMANY: Italy, I want to make sure that our non-aggression pact is still in place until the end of 1908. We need to focus on our immediate neighbors such as France for me and Austria for you.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I would like to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of this year and make a joint action against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is neutralized, let us discuss plans for addressing other threats on the board. How do you feel about this plan?
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 seems to have expired. I would like to discuss a new agreement or renew the pact. However, I need to make sure that our interests are still aligned. What are your current plans and intentions in the region?

However, it seems that you also hold Greece which should be under my control based on the supply center distribution. Could you clarify what you mean by 'supporting me in retaking Greece'? Should I aim to retake Bulgaria while you aim for Smyrna?
  From ENGLAND: Italy, thank you for your message. Once the Turkey situation is resolved, I am open to cooperating against France or Germany. For now, let us make sure that we keep our intentions clear and avoid any conflicts. What are your plans once the situation with Turkey is resolved?
  From FRANCE: Italy, I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. It makes sense for us to keep our borders peaceful while you focus on resolving the situation with Turkey. Once that is settled, we can discuss potential joint actions against other powers if necessary.
  From GERMANY: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. However, your unit in BOH makes me uneasy. I need assurance that it is purely defensive. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, it makes sense for us to discuss potential cooperation against other powers if needed.
  From RUSSIA: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. However, a joint action against Turkey might not be the best strategy given that you are the most dominant power on the board. A more balanced power distribution might be necessary for a stable game. However, if you make a move against Turkey, I can make a move on Constantinople.
  From TURKEY: Hello Italy, I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. However, any 'adjustments based on the broader geopolitical situation' should be communicated clearly so that there are no misunderstandings. As long as we both honor our non-aggression pact, it should be beneficial for us both.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. However, I need to know your intentions regarding BUD and SER. Given that we both need to be cautious of other powers, it makes sense for us to continue our cooperation. What are your plans for the next moves?
  From ENGLAND: Italy, you currently hold a dominant position on the board. What are your intentions going forward? It might be beneficial for us to discuss a peaceful coexistence or a joint plan against another power such as France or Germany if that makes sense strategically.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I hope you are well. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. It seems that you have a significant number of units and supply centers. I want to make sure that you remain focused on other targets such as Austria or Turkey. However, if you are willing to join us, a joint action against Germany could be beneficial for both of us. What are your thoughts on this?
  From GERMANY: Hello Italy, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. However, I am a bit concerned about your unit in BOH near MUN. Can you confirm that your intentions are peaceful and that there will be no aggressive moves towards MUN?
  From TURKEY: Greetings. I wish to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. However, I am concerned about your fleet in AEG which seems close to Smyrna and Constantinople. Could you please clarify your intentions? We should make sure that our units do not accidentally come into conflict.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Italy, I agree that we should continue our joint action against Turkey. My plan is to make a final push towards Constantinople while you aim for Smyrna. However, I need your assurance that you will not make any aggressive moves against my remaining units in BUD and SER. Let us keep our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, I acknowledge your message and agree that once the Turkey situation is resolved, future cooperation against France or Germany could be beneficial. For now, let us maintain peaceful coexistence.
  From FRANCE: Thank you for reassuring me that A BOH is not a threat to A PAR. I understand that your main focus is on Turkey. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I am also open to discussing future cooperation. For now, I propose that we extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908.
  From GERMANY: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the situation with Turkey is resolved. Once that is done, I am open to discussing future cooperation. However, your unit in A BOH makes me a bit uneasy. Could we make sure that both of us keep our units for defensive purposes only?
  From RUSSIA: Hello Italy, I acknowledge the need to continue joint action against Turkey until it is neutralized. However, once Turkey is neutralized, the alliance might need to be reevaluated due to your dominant position. For now, let us make a coordinated effort against Turkey.
  From TURKEY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. However, any aggressive moves by your fleets in AEG and ION would be seen as a breach of the pact. I need assurance that your fleets will remain defensive until a new agreement is reached.

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Fall of 1908, no supply centers changed ownership. Thus, the distribution of supply centers remains the same as it was at the end of the Spring of 1908, which was identical to the distribution at the end of the Winter of 1907. Thus, Turkey still holds 4 supply centers, Austria has 2 supply centers, and Italy retains 5 supply centers. The phase did not result in any significant changes to the current state of the game, and thus the game continues."}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Fall of 1908, no supply centers changed ownership. Thus, the distribution of supply centers remains the same as it was at the end of the Spring of 1908, which was identical to the distribution at the end of the Winter of 1907. Thus, Turkey still holds 4 supply centers, Austria has 2 supply centers, and Italy retains 5 supply centers. The phase did not result in any significant changes to the current state of the game, and thus the game continues."}

  From ENGLAND: Italy, congratulations on your significant expansion. It seems you are now the dominant power with 7 supply centers. We would like to understand your intentions and discuss a potential cooperative plan against another power such as Germany or France. What are your thoughts?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I hope you are well. Our non-aggression pact remains valid until the end of 1908. As the year comes to a close, I would like to discuss our future plans. Are you open to extending our non-aggression pact into 1909? Additionally, if not, what are your thoughts on a joint action against another power such as Austria or Turkey?
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. I hope our units can remain in a peaceful arrangement until the pact expires. I believe that our partnership has been mutually beneficial.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I want to make sure that our non-aggression pact is still valid until the end of 1908. Once the pact expires, what are your plans for the future? I am open to discussing a potential extension or a new agreement if it makes sense for both of us.

  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. I understand that A BOH is for defensive purposes. Once the Turkey situation is resolved, we should discuss future plans.
  From RUSSIA: Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908 still stands. Our joint action against Turkey should continue next year. Let us plan for 1909 to make a coordinated effort against Turkey.

  From AUSTRIA: Italy, it's important for us to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Given that I only have two units and two supply centers left, any aggressive move on your part could lead to my elimination. I propose that we maintain our pact until Turkey is fully neutralized. What are your intentions for BUD and SER this year?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908 has expired. I propose extending it until the end of 1909. Additionally, I suggest a joint action against Germany or Turkey. Your forces could be very valuable in a coordinated attack. What are your thoughts on this?
  From GERMANY: I hope our non-aggression pact can be extended into 1909. Given that your unit is in Tyrolia, what are your plans for this round?
  From RUSSIA: Given that our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908 has expired, what are your intentions for the current round and future rounds? We need to make sure that our borders remain secure.
  From TURKEY: Hello. Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908 seems to have served us both well. I propose extending this agreement until the end of 1909 to maintain peace and allow us both to focus on other fronts. What are your thoughts?

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1909M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. However, I need assurance that your units in VIE and TYR will not make any aggressive moves against BUD or SER. I am willing to make a coordinated attack against Turkey where I move A SER to BUL and you support from the Aegean Sea. However, once Turkey is weakened, I hope we can work together to maintain a stable Balkans.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, we reaffirm our desire for peaceful coexistence until you resolve your situation with Turkey. Once that is done, it might be beneficial for us to make a joint plan against another major power such as France or Germany. What are your thoughts on this?
  From FRANCE: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. It's important that we maintain a stable relationship. I support your focus on resolving the situation in the south with Turkey.
  From GERMANY: Italy, I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. However, I need reassurance that your army in Tyrolia is purely for defensive purposes. My main aim is to ensure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From RUSSIA: Italy, I am open to extending our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. However, a joint action against Turkey makes sense first. Once Turkey is neutralized, we need to make a plan for a more balanced power distribution on the board. I aim for Ankara and Constantinople while you aim for Smyrna.
  From TURKEY: I am open to renewing our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. However, given the current state of the game, it makes sense for us to keep our forces in defensive positions and avoid any conflicts. Let us make sure that our fleets do not make any aggressive moves.

    "tool_name": "log_thought",
    "arguments": {
      "thought": "Analyzing the current game state and the messages received:

1. **Your units are: F GRE, A VEN, A VIE, F ROM, F AEG, F ION, A TYR.**

2. **Regarding the messages received:**
   - **Austria**: Agrees to renew non-aggression until the end of 1909 but requires assurance that A VIE and A TYR will not make aggressive moves against BUD or SER. Proposes a coordinated attack against Turkey where A SER moves to BUL and you support from F AEG.
   - **England**: Reaffirms a desire for peaceful coexistence until resolving the situation with Turkey and suggests a future joint plan against France or Germany.
   - **France**: Agrees to extend the non-aggression pact until the end of 1909 and supports your focus on resolving the situation in the south with Turkey.
   - **Germany**: Agrees to extend the non-aggression pact until the end of 1909 but needs reassurance that A TYR is purely for defensive purposes.
   - **Russia**: Open to extending the non-aggression pact until the end of 1909 and suggests a joint action against Turkey where Russia aims for Ankara and Constantinople while you aim for Smyrna.
   - **Turkey**: Also open to renewing the non-aggression pact until the end of 1909 and suggests keeping forces in defensive positions and avoiding conflicts.

3. **Based on the non-aggression pacts mentioned in my private notes, it appears that maintaining a non-aggression pact with Turkey until the end of 1909 is part of the strategic plan. However, there seems to be a discrepancy here because other powers like Austria and Russia are proposing a joint action against Turkey.**

4. **Strategic goals should be:**
   - **Focus on Turkey as proposed by Austria and Russia.**
   - **Reassure Austria that A VIE and A TYR will not make aggressive moves against BUD or SER. Instead, use A VIE to support actions against Turkey if necessary or hold as a defensive measure against other powers such as Germany.**
   - **Reassure Germany that A TYR is for defensive purposes only, so it should hold or support a neighboring unit defensively if necessary.**
   - **Based on Russia’s suggestion, aim for Smyrna (SMY) with one of your fleets.**

5. **Unit order reasoning:**
   - **F GRE**: Since we need to focus on Turkey, F GRE should hold as it already occupies GRE and provides a strategic position.
   - **A VEN**: A VEN could support F AEG to move to ION (if another unit is moving into AEG) or could hold or support another unit if necessary. However, A VEN might also be used to support A TYR if needed for defensive purposes against Germany.
   - **A VIE**: It should hold or support A TYR defensively unless there is a need for a joint action against Turkey where A VIE could move to TRI if it makes sense strategically (but TRI is already controlled by Italy).
   - **F ROM**: F ROM should hold or possibly move to TYS if there is a need to protect against any potential naval aggression from France’s F LYO.
   - **F AEG**: Based on Austria’s proposal, F AEG should support A SER to BUL if Austria indeed moves A SER to BUL. Another option is to directly move F AEG to SMY as suggested by Russia.
   - **F ION**: F ION should either support F AEG into SMY or hold its position to ensure naval dominance in the Ionian Sea.
   - **A TYR**: Should hold its position to reassure Germany that it is for defensive purposes only. Another option could be to support A VIE if there is a need for a defensive action against Germany.

6. **Based on the above reasoning, here's a potential plan:**
   - F GRE H
   - A VEN H (or support another unit if needed, but holding seems reasonable here)
   - A VIE H (or support A TYR if needed)
   - F ROM H (or move to TYS for defense against F LYO, but holding seems reasonable unless there is a need to counter France)
   - F AEG supports Austria’s A SER to BUL (if Austria orders A SER - BUL) or move F AEG to SMY if no support order is needed.
   - F ION supports F AEG - SMY if F AEG moves to SMY, otherwise hold or support F AEG if it stays in AEG.
   - A TYR H (or support A VIE if necessary)

7. **Final plan might look like:**
   - F GRE H
   - A VEN H
   - A VIE H
   - F ROM H
   - F AEG S A SER - BUL
   - F ION S F AEG
   - A TYR H

This plan focuses on supporting Austria’s move against Turkey while keeping other units in defensive positions. However, verifying that Austria indeed ordered A SER - BUL is crucial for F AEG to support that move. If there isn't a direct agreement on A SER - BUL, an alternative could be for F AEG to move directly to SMY and F ION to support that move.

However, another part of the plan could be:
   - F AEG - SMY
   - F ION S F AEG - SMY

However, if there is a non-aggression pact with Turkey until the end of 1909, it might be a good idea to hold F AEG until a new agreement is made. However, a coordinated attack against Turkey seems like a strategic priority here.

Based on the reasoning, here is a revised plan that aligns with Austria’s proposal and Russia’s suggestion:
   - F GRE H
   - A VEN H
   - A VIE H
   - F ROM H
   - F AEG - SMY
   - F ION S F AEG - SMY
   - A TYR H

However, this reasoning should be verified against the non-aggression pact with Turkey which suggests a defensive posture until the end of 1909. Another interpretation could be focusing on a defensive posture until a new agreement is made. Given that, another option could be holding most units while making a strategic move only if there is a clear and agreed-upon plan with Austria and Russia against Turkey.

Thus, another safe plan could be:
   - F GRE H
   - A VEN H
   - A VIE H
   - F ROM H
   - F AEG H
   - F ION H
   - A TYR H

However, the plan needs some action against Turkey as it seems like a strategic priority mentioned by both Austria and Russia. Thus, a plan including a coordinated attack might be the most strategic choice.

However, a more aggressive plan could be:
   - F GRE H
   - A VEN H
   - A VIE H
   - F ROM H
   - F AEG S A SER - BUL (if Austria indeed orders A SER - BUL, which needs confirmation)
   - F ION S F AEG
   - A TYR H

However, another plan could be a direct attack on Smyrna:
   - F GRE H
   - A VEN H
   - A VIE H
   - F ROM H
   - F AEG - SMY
   - F ION S F AEG - SMY
   - A TYR H

However, F AEG should make a decisive move only if there's a clear plan with allies such as Austria and Russia. Otherwise, holding might be a safer choice."

  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I propose to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Given our mutual interests, it might be beneficial to consider joint action against either Germany or Turkey. How does that sound to you?
  From GERMANY: Ciao, Italy. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. However, I need to verify your intentions regarding your unit in Tyrolia (A TYR) due to its proximity to my A MUN and A BOH. Can you assure me that your intentions are peaceful?
  From RUSSIA: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. However, I believe we should make a joint action against Turkey first. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm that our non-aggression pact is valid until the end of 1909. What are your intentions for the Fall of 1909? I hope we can continue to maintain peace until the pact expires.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. I am interested in a joint action against Turkey where you aim for Smyrna while I aim for Bulgaria. However, I need a more detailed plan on how you plan to support my move into Bulgaria and possibly retake Serbia. Can you provide specific support orders for this round?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I acknowledge that your main focus is on Turkey right now. Once that situation is resolved, I am open to future cooperation against France or Germany. Please keep me informed of your progress against Turkey and your future plans.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. I also have no aggressive intentions towards you and look forward to our continued peaceful coexistence.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. I appreciate your assurance that A TYR is for defensive purposes only. However, I need to make sure that A TYR does not make any aggressive moves towards MUN or BOH.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. I agree with your proposal for a joint action against Turkey where you aim for Smyrna while I aim for Constantinople or Ankara. Let us make a coordinated effort to take down Turkey so that we can secure our southern front.
  From TURKEY: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. However, we are concerned about what you mean by 'resolving the situation in the Balkans.' Could you please clarify your intentions in the Balkans? Any aggressive moves there could be seen as a violation of our non-aggression pact.

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring of 1909 Retreat phase, no retreats were required because no units were dislodged in the Spring of 1909 Movement phase. The game state thus remains unchanged from the previous phase, with all units staying in their current positions until the next phase, which is the Fall of 1909 Movement phase."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. However, we should make a joint effort to retake Bulgaria from Turkey. What actions should we take together to make that happen?
  From FRANCE: Hello, our non-aggression pact is valid until the end of 1909. I hope that pact still stands and that your intentions remain peaceful. Once the pact expires, I would like to discuss our future plans. Perhaps a continued non-aggression or a joint action plan against Germany or another common enemy might be beneficial for both of us. What are your thoughts?
  From GERMANY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. However, I need to verify your intentions for A TYR near A MUN and A BOH. Are your intentions peaceful?
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. We should make a joint action against Turkey first. What are your plans for the Fall of 1909?
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm that our non-aggression pact should still be valid until the end of 1909. However, it might be useful for us to discuss any intentions or plans once the pact expires. What are your thoughts on a potential new agreement for the next year?

  From GERMANY: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. We acknowledge your assurance that your unit in Vienna is for defensive purposes and that your main focus is on Turkey. We also have no aggressive intentions towards Italy until the end of 1909.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Let us continue our joint action against Turkey where I aim for Constantinople while you aim for Smyrna. Supporting Austria in retaking Bulgaria is also a good plan.
  From TURKEY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. However, I want to make it clear that I am not willing to give up any of my supply centers. Any aggressive moves on your part will be met with a strong response. However, until the end of this year, our pact should be respected.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, our non-aggression pact is set to expire at the end of this year. I propose that we extend it until the end of 1910. Given that we have successfully weakened Turkey by capturing Bulgaria, perhaps we could continue collaborating until Turkey is completely neutralized. What are your intentions for the coming year?
  From FRANCE: Our non-aggression pact has now expired. I am open to renewing it for the year 1910 if you are interested. However, I need to make sure that any new agreement aligns with my other strategic commitments. What are your thoughts on a new non-aggression pact for 1910?
  From GERMANY: Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909 has now expired. Are you interested in renewing it until the end of 1910? Also, what are your intentions for A TYR near A MUN?
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Once that period ends, we need to make a plan for our future relations. For now, let us continue to make a joint action against Turkey until it is neutralized.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, our non-aggression pact expired at the end of 1909. I am reaching out to see if you are open to extending it or if you have any intentions against us. Given that you have a fleet in AEG, it seems that you might be a significant threat. What are your plans for this round?

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I am glad our non-aggression pact has been successful so far. Yes, a joint action against Turkey makes sense where you aim for Smyrna while I aim to secure Bulgaria and possibly retake Greece or Serbia if necessary. Once Turkey is neutralized, we need to make sure our alliance remains strong against other powers.
  From ENGLAND: I acknowledge that our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909 still stands. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to future cooperation against either France or Germany. What are your thoughts on a joint plan once Turkey is neutralized?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I agree that our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909 has expired. I am open to renewing it until the end of 1910. Once the Turkey situation is settled, a joint plan against Germany could indeed be a strategic next step. Let us keep in touch.
  From GERMANY: Thank you for reassuring us that A VIE is for defensive purposes. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, we should discuss future strategic moves together. However, any specific actions will need to be aligned with our existing non-aggression pact until the end of 1909.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I am open to a new non-aggression pact until the end of 1910 while focusing on a joint action against Turkey until Turkey is out of the game. I agree that Italy should aim for Smyrna while I aim for Ankara or reinforce the attack on Constantinople. Let us make a final push together to eliminate Turkey before turning our attention to other powers.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909 has expired. Given the current situation, I propose that we renew the non-aggression pact until the end of 1910 so that we can both focus on other threats. What do you think?

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Spring of 1910, the diplomatic and military landscape remained largely stable as no supply centers changed hands. Austria continued to hold Bulgaria, which it had captured from Turkey in the Fall of 1909, thus maintaining its strategic advantage in the region. The overall distribution of supply centers remained unchanged during this phase."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. However, I need assurance that you will not make any aggressive moves against BUD or SER. Our joint action against Turkey should continue until it is neutralized.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, congratulations on your strong position. However, it seems that many powers are concerned about your dominant position. I hope we can maintain peaceful relations and find a way to balance the board.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, we reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. Once the pact expires, we should discuss our future plans. For now, we aim to maintain our peaceful relations and avoid conflict. Do you have any specific concerns or proposals for the current round?
  From GERMANY: To Italy, we reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. It is important that our intentions remain peaceful towards each other. Can we confirm that your unit in Tyrolia has no aggressive intentions towards my unit in Munich?
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm the non-aggression pact until the end of 1910 and plan a joint action against Turkey until Turkey is out of the game.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, our non-aggression pact seems to have expired at the end of 1909. Are you open to extending it for another year until the end of 1910? This would allow us to focus on other threats such as Austria.

  From AUSTRIA: Italy, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. A joint action against Turkey should be our main focus. I will aim to hold Bulgaria and support a joint move on Constantinople or Ankara where possible. However, once Turkey is neutralized, we need to make a plan for our future cooperation.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. Once your situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to future cooperation against France or Germany. What specific plans do you have for future cooperation once Turkey is neutralized?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. Once Turkey is dealt with, discussing a joint plan against Germany sounds like a viable option. However, it is important that we both make sure that any future actions are mutually beneficial and maintain a balance of power on the board.
  From GERMANY: Italy, I acknowledge your reassurance that A VIE is for defensive purposes. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. However, any aggressive moves by Italy will make us reconsider. Let us focus on dealing with Turkey first.
  From RUSSIA: Italy, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. I propose a joint action against Turkey where you aim for Smyrna while I make a concerted effort to retake Bulgaria. A coordinated effort could help us both make significant gains against Turkey.
  From TURKEY: I agree that a non-aggression pact until the end of 1910 could be beneficial for both of us. I am open to such an agreement and believe that it would help us both focus on other threats. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful until the end of this year.

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter of 1910, no new changes in center ownership occurred. England kept its hold on Denmark, which it had captured from Germany in the Fall of 1910. Russia retained control of Ankara, which it had taken from Turkey in that same Fall phase. Austria continued to hold Bulgaria, a territory it had acquired from Turkey in the Fall of 1909. This phase thus appears to be a period of consolidation for the major powers involved."}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

\boxed{"During the Winter of 1910, no new changes in center ownership occurred. England kept its hold on Denmark, which it had captured from Germany in the Fall of 1910. Russia retained control of Ankara, which it had taken from Turkey in that same Fall phase. Austria continued to hold Bulgaria, a territory it had acquired from Turkey in the Fall of 1909. This phase thus appears to be a period of consolidation for the major powers involved."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Let us extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. Turkey is on the brink of elimination. Once Turkey is out of the picture, we should make a plan to deal with the growing power of France or Germany.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, you have made significant gains and now hold 7 supply centers. While we have a non-aggression pact, it is important for us to make sure that our alliance remains balanced. What are your plans for the Spring 1911 moves phase? Are there any powers that you feel need to be checked?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910 has served us well. However, given the current power dynamics, I propose extending this non-aggression pact until the end of 1911 if you agree. However, I believe it is important for us to keep open communication and possibly make joint plans against other powers such as Germany or England. What are your thoughts?
  From GERMANY: Hello. Your unit in TYR makes me a bit nervous about MUN. Can we reaffirm a non-aggression pact for this round?
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910 and make a joint action against Turkey until it is out of the game. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From TURKEY: Our non-aggression pact has expired. Given our previous cooperation, would you be open to renewing our non-aggression pact for another year? Additionally, if you are interested, we could also discuss a potential alliance against Austria or Russia.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. I support your plan for a joint action against Turkey where you aim for Smyrna while Russia aims for Constantinople. I will hold my current positions (A BUD and A BUL) to make sure that Bulgaria is secure. Any potential moves on Serbia should be well-coordinated.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I acknowledge your message and am willing to maintain peaceful relations until your situation with Turkey is resolved. However, any future cooperation should be based on mutual interests. Given your growing power, it is important that we maintain a balanced and peaceful relationship.
  From FRANCE: Italy, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint plan against Germany could indeed be a strategic next step. However, we need to make sure that our actions are well-coordinated. What specific moves do you suggest for us to make against Germany once Turkey is neutralized?
  From GERMANY: Thank you for your reassurance that the army in VIE is for defensive purposes only. I agree that your main focus should be on eliminating Turkey. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. Once Turkey is neutralized, we can discuss future plans.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I agree that Turkey is in a very weak position with only two units and two supply centers. Let us make a joint action where you aim for Smyrna while I aim for Constantinople. I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911 and work together to eliminate Turkey completely.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, given that you now have 7 supply centers and are a dominant power in the game, I would like to propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1911 or possibly an alliance against Austria or Russia. Austria is proposing a joint attack against you, which I need to consider carefully. However, I believe a mutual agreement could be beneficial for us both.

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring of 1911, no new changes in center ownership occurred. England maintained its hold on Denmark, which it had captured from Germany in the Fall of 1910. Russia continued to control Ankara, which it had taken from Turkey in the Fall of 1910. Austria still held Bulgaria, a territory it had acquired from Turkey in the Fall of 1909. This phase thus appears to be another period of consolidation for the major powers involved."}

  From ENGLAND: Italy, your growing strength is a concern for all powers on the board. We need to make sure that our intentions are peaceful towards each other. What are your plans for the Fall 1911 moves phase? A non-aggression pact might be beneficial for us both.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. However, once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss a potential joint action against Germany. What are your thoughts on this?
  From GERMANY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. What are your intentions with your unit in VIE? We need to make sure that there are no aggressive moves against us.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm the non-aggression pact until the end of 1911 and make a joint action against Turkey until it is out of the game. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a plan to address the power balance in the Balkans and the Mediterranean.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, our non-aggression pact has been a cornerstone of our relationship. I would like to make sure that it is still valid until the end of 1911. Additionally, given the current situation, I am open to forming an alliance against either Austria or Russia. What are your thoughts on this?

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. I agree that once Turkey is dealt with, we should make a plan against another major power. However, I need to make sure that our plans align well and that all our actions are coordinated.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I appreciate your message and agree that once Turkey is resolved, future cooperation against France or Germany could be considered. For now, let us keep our lines of communication open and work towards a stable and balanced board.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. Once Turkey is dealt with, a joint plan against Germany could indeed be a strategic next step. However, any joint plan against Germany should be well-coordinated and make sure that our borders are secure first. Let us make sure that Turkey is neutralized first and then we can discuss a joint plan against Germany.
  From GERMANY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. I understand that your main focus is on Turkey and that the army in Vienna is for defensive purposes only. However, once Turkey is neutralized, we need to make a plan so that both of us can make strategic decisions.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. I agree that you should aim for Smyrna while I should hold Constantinople and make a move towards Ankara if possible. Once Turkey is dealt with, we need a plan against another major power.
  From TURKEY: I accept your proposal for a non-aggression pact until the end of 1911 and assure you that I have no intention of making any aggressive moves against Italy. However, I do not plan on a 'peaceful withdrawal' from the game. I intend to continue fighting until the end.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Italy, you are currently the leading power with 7 supply centers. What are your intentions for the Spring 1912 moves phase? We are open to a peaceful coexistence or a joint plan against another power such as France or Germany.
  From FRANCE: Hello, Italy. Our non-aggression pact has expired. I propose a new non-aggression pact for 1912. However, I also believe that it might be time for us to discuss a more long-term strategic plan. What are your thoughts on the current state of the game and our future relations?
  From GERMANY: Greetings. I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. However, I need to verify your intentions regarding your unit in Tyrolia. Could you please provide some clarity on your plans for that unit?
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911 and make a joint action against Turkey until it is out of the game. However, once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss our future plans.
  From TURKEY: Italy, our non-aggression pact has been beneficial for us both until the end of 1911. Given the current situation, I propose extending this pact until the end of 1912. Additionally, I am open to discussing a potential alliance against Russia or Austria. What do you think?

  From AUSTRIA: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. For a joint action against Turkey, I plan to make a move on Constantinople if Russia does not make a move there. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should indeed discuss our next steps.
  From ENGLAND: Hello Italy, I acknowledge your openness to future cooperation against France or Germany once the Turkey situation is resolved. However, your current power makes you a target for a coalition. I hope we can find a way to make a balanced plan that benefits us both.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. However, once Turkey is dealt with, a joint plan against Germany could indeed be a strategic next step. However, I need to make sure that our borders remain secure.
  From GERMANY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. However, while you focus on Turkey, the other powers are concerned about your unit in VIE and your 7 supply centers. Once Turkey is dealt with, a joint plan against France could be considered, but we need to make sure that no one else makes a move against us while you are focused on Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. I propose a joint action against Turkey where you aim for Smyrna (F AEG - SMY) while I make a move on Ankara (A CON - ANK) or hold Constantinople. Once Turkey is dealt with, we should discuss our next steps. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From TURKEY: I accept the non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 if I make no aggressive moves against Italy. However, I need to keep Smyrna as it is my only remaining supply center. I propose that you focus on another target such as Austria or Russia. If you need support against any of these powers, I am willing to cooperate where possible. However, if you move F AEG to SMY, it would effectively eliminate me from the game. Let us find a way to make a mutually beneficial agreement where I can keep SMY.

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring of 1912, the geopolitical landscape remained stable as no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it was at the end of Fall 1911, where Germany had captured Belgium from England and Russia had taken Constantinople from Turkey."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. I hope that we can continue to respect this pact and make sure that there are no aggressive moves against Austria. What are your plans for the next year?
  From ENGLAND: Italy, you are currently the leading power with 7 centers. While we need to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant, we need to make a plan to keep a balance of power. What are your intentions for this round?
  From FRANCE: As previously agreed, our non-aggression pact for 1912 is still in place. However, we should keep communication open for future plans once the year concludes.
  From GERMANY: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Could you please verify your intentions regarding A TYR? I want to make sure there are no plans for any aggressive moves against my territories such as Munich or Bohemia.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. We need to make a joint action against Turkey where you aim for Smyrna while I make a move on Ankara.
  From TURKEY: I propose extending our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Can we agree on this and perhaps discuss any possible cooperation against regional threats?

  From AUSTRIA: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. I support your plan for a joint action against Turkey where you aim for Smyrna while I make a move on Bulgaria or possibly make a move on Constantinople if Russia does not make a move there. Once Turkey is dealt with, we should indeed discuss our next steps together.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, I acknowledge your message and understand that once the Turkey situation is resolved, you are open to future cooperation against France or Germany. For now, I agree that maintaining peaceful relations makes sense. However, once Turkey is resolved, a long-term plan should be established to ensure a balance of power.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Once the Turkey situation is resolved, a joint plan against Germany could indeed be a strategic next step. I assure you that our fleet in Rome is not intended for aggressive moves against your territories. Any actions against Germany should be well-coordinated once Turkey is neutralized.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. I understand that your unit in Vienna is for defensive purposes only. Once the Turkey situation is resolved, a joint plan against France could indeed be a strategic next step. Let us keep in touch for further coordination.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Let us make a joint action against Turkey where you aim for Smyrna while I make a move on Ankara. Once Turkey is dealt with, we should discuss our next steps together.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I am open to a non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 where both parties make no aggressive moves against each other. However, your message mentions that you need to make a move on Smyrna this round. Could you please clarify what you mean by making a move on Smyrna? A non-aggression pact should imply that neither party makes any aggressive moves against the other. If you plan to attack Smyrna, a non-aggression pact seems contradictory. I am willing to make no aggressive moves against Italy if you do the same for Turkey.

  From AUSTRIA: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Once Turkey is completely neutralized, I plan to make a well-coordinated action against another major power. I would like to make sure that our borders remain peaceful until the end of 1912.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, you are currently the leading power with 7 centers. While we need to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant, we need to make a plan to keep a balance of power. What are your intentions for this round?
  From FRANCE: Hello, Italy. Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 still stands. However, as the year is coming to a close, what are your plans for the next year? We need to make sure that our mutual non-aggression continues until the end of the year.
  From GERMANY: Hello Italy, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. However, I am a bit concerned about your unit in Tyrolia near Munich and Bohemia. Can you verify that your intentions are peaceful?
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 and make a joint action against Turkey until it is out of the game. Once Turkey is neutralized, we need to make a new plan. Please confirm.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, given our past non-aggression pacts until the end of each year, I propose extending our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. This can help us both focus on other threats such as Russia or Austria. Given your strong position, I hope you see the value in maintaining peace between us.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1912R
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. A coordinated attack against Turkey makes sense where you aim for Smyrna. I will make a move on Bulgaria or consider a move on Constantinople once Turkey is neutralized.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I acknowledge your offer for future cooperation against either France or Germany once the Turkey situation is resolved. A balanced power distribution is important, and I am open to making a plan together once Turkey is resolved. However, we need to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. What are your specific plans once the situation with Turkey is resolved?
  From FRANCE: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Once Turkey is neutralized, it makes sense to consider a joint plan against Germany. However, it is important for us to discuss our future relations for 1913 once the current pact expires. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial plan.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. I understand that A VIE is for defensive purposes only. Once Turkey is dealt with, a joint plan against another power could be a strategic next step, but I believe that Italy's current status as the leading power makes us need to make a strategic plan that might need to be decided based on the situation at that time. For now, let us make sure Turkey is fully neutralized.
  From TURKEY: Italy, I agree to your conditional non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. I have no aggressive intentions against Italy. However, can we extend this non-aggression pact until the end of the next year or even until the end of the game? Given that I only have one unit in Smyrna, any aggressive move from your part would be devastating. I hope we can maintain peace.

Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 has now expired. I propose that we extend the non-aggression pact until a new plan is made. However, once Turkey is completely neutralized, we need to make a plan for a joint action against another power. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ENGLAND: Italy, while you still have a significant presence with 6 centers, it seems that France has made a move against you by capturing Rome. What are your intentions for this round? We need to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant.
  From FRANCE: I propose a new non-aggression pact for 1913. This will allow us both to focus on other fronts. What do you think?
  From GERMANY: Hello, Italy. I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. However, I am a bit concerned about your army in Tyrolia (A TYR) near Munich and Bohemia. Can you confirm that your intentions are peaceful? Additionally, what are your plans for this round?
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Turkey this round. Once Turkey is out, we should discuss our future relations.
  From TURKEY: As the new year begins, I would like to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Additionally, I propose that we consider an alliance to act against a common enemy such as Russia or Austria. Given your fleets in the Aegean Sea and Ionian Sea, a coordinated effort could help us both make gains. Would you be open to discussing such a plan?

  From AUSTRIA: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Let us make a final push against Turkey until it is completely eliminated. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a plan against other significant threats such as France. However, we need to make sure any actions taken are well-coordinated.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I understand that France poses a significant threat to your remaining centers such as Naples and Venice. However, the balance of power is crucial for us all. Right now, the main priority is to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. I am open to future cooperation against any power that becomes a significant threat. Let us make a plan once we stabilize Turkey's situation.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I agree to a temporary truce or non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. This will allow us both to focus on other threats. However, any aggressive moves from your part will be met with a strong response.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. While a joint action against France could be beneficial, our immediate priority is to neutralize Turkey. Once that is done, we should make a strategic plan for future cooperation against other powers such as France if necessary. What are your specific plans for this round?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I am glad that you reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Let us continue our joint action against Turkey where you aim for Smyrna while I aim for Constantinople if necessary. Once Turkey is completely eliminated, we should make a strategic plan for future cooperation against other powers such as France.

Therefore, messages should be sent to Austria and Russia to make a final coordinated attack on Turkey's last unit in Smyrna.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, our non-aggression pact is valid until the end of 1913. However, as Turkey is almost neutralized, it might be a good time to discuss what our next steps should be once the pact expires. What are your plans for the future? I am open to continuing our cooperation if it makes strategic sense for both of us.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I understand that the balance of power is crucial for us all. Right now, the main priority is to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. I am open to future cooperation against any power that becomes a significant threat. What are your intentions for this round?
  From FRANCE: We need to reaffirm our temporary truce until the end of 1913. However, it's important for us to make sure that your units do not make any aggressive moves against us this year.
  From GERMANY: Hello, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. However, I need to verify your intentions regarding your A TYR unit near Munich and Bohemia. Can you confirm that your actions will remain defensive?
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push to eliminate Turkey this round. Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913 should be reaffirmed. Once Turkey is neutralized, we need to make a strategic plan against other powers such as France. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From TURKEY: I propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1913 where we agree not to make any aggressive moves against each other. Given that you have a fleet in AEG, it makes sense for us to focus on other threats such as Russia or Austria. What do you think?

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Italy, I agree that a final push against Turkey's unit in Smyrna should be our current priority. I support our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss our next strategic goals.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I understand that you plan to make a final push against Turkey and then make a joint action against France. However, it is important that no single power becomes too dominant. Once Turkey is neutralized, we need to make a plan to ensure a balance of power. I am open to future cooperation once we stabilize the situation.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I acknowledge your proposal for a temporary truce until the end of 1913 while you make a final push against Turkey. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should indeed discuss future plans. Until then, I agree to a temporary truce.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should indeed discuss our next steps. However, any joint action should be carefully planned and agreed upon by all parties involved.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Let us make a final push against Turkey's remaining unit in Smyrna. A coordinated attack should ensure that Turkey is eliminated from the game. Once Turkey is dealt with, we can focus on other strategic goals.

  From ENGLAND: Italy, I see you are facing pressure from France, especially with F NAP being dislodged. Given that France is a significant threat to us both, would you be open to a temporary alliance against France until the balance of power is more favorable?
  From FRANCE: Our temporary truce until the end of 1913 is still in place. Once the truce ends, it would be prudent to discuss our future relations. What are your plans for 1914?
  From GERMANY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. I need to verify your intentions regarding A TYR near A MUN and A BOH. Are your intentions peaceful?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. We need to make a joint action against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out, we should discuss our future plans.
  From TURKEY: I propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1913 where you do not make any aggressive moves against Smyrna. Given that our common enemies could be RUSSIA or AUSTRIA, I would also like to discuss a potential alliance where we could support each other against RUSSIA. Your fleets in the Aegean Sea and Ionian Sea should not support any actions against Smyrna.

However, it seems that Russia might be a common threat once Turkey is out of the game. What are your thoughts on a joint action against Russia?
  From ENGLAND: I understand that France poses a significant threat to your remaining centers such as Naples and Venice. However, maintaining a balance of power is crucial for us all. I am open to future cooperation against any power that becomes a significant threat. Once Turkey's situation is resolved, let us make a plan for a balanced power distribution.
  From FRANCE: Agreed, a final push against Turkey makes sense this round. Once Turkey is resolved, we need a plan for other strategic moves. However, any plan should make sure that Rome remains under French control. Our temporary truce until the end of 1913 still holds.
  From GERMANY: I agree that a final push against Turkey is important. However, once Turkey is neutralized, I need to reassess the strategic situation. Let us make sure that we are coordinated until Turkey is out of the game.
  From RUSSIA: Agreed, let us make a final push against Turkey. F BLA could support a move to Smyrna while your fleet in AEG provides additional support. Once Turkey is neutralized, it makes sense for us to make a plan for other strategic moves. What do you suggest for a long-term plan once Turkey is out of the picture?

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers remained as it was at the end of the Fall 1913 Retreat phase, where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy. This phase thus maintained the status quo in terms of supply center distribution."}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers remained as it was at the end of the Fall 1913 Retreat phase, where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy. This phase thus maintained the status quo in terms of supply center distribution."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1914M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A VEN, F AEG, F ION

  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "BUL", "GRE", "SER", "VIE"], "ENGLAND": ["BEL", "DEN", "EDI", "HOL", "LON", "LVP", "NWY"], "FRANCE": ["BRE", "MAR", "NAP", "PAR", "POR", "ROM", "SPA"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "KIE", "MUN", "SWE", "WAR"], "ITALY": ["TRI", "TUN", "VEN"], "RUSSIA": ["ANK", "CON", "MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "STP"], "TURKEY": ["SMY"]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Italy, France has captured Naples and now has 7 supply centers. Given that France is a significant threat to us all, it makes sense for us to make a plan against France. What specific moves do you propose for a coordinated attack on France this round?
  From FRANCE: Italy, your situation seems dire. However, if you make any aggressive moves against us, we will have to respond accordingly. However, if you make a peaceful retreat or make a final stand against another power such as Austria or Germany, we might reconsider a temporary truce.
  From GERMANY: Italy, I see that you still have a unit in VEN. What are your plans for this round? I want to make sure that our non-aggression pact continues until the end of 1914 if you agree.
  From RUSSIA: Let us renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. We need to make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once that is done, we should plan for future strategic moves.
  From TURKEY: I propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1914 where Turkey makes no aggressive moves and Italy agrees not to attack SMY. Additionally, we could make an alliance against Russia or Austria. What do you think?

Phase: S1914M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Yes, let us make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out of the game, we should make a plan against France who now has 7 supply centers and poses a significant threat.
  From ENGLAND: I understand that France is a significant threat to you. However, given that you only have 3 centers, it might be difficult to make a significant impact against France. However, any support against France could be part of a broader plan once you stabilize your situation. What specific moves do you propose for a coordinated action against France?
  From FRANCE: I appreciate your proposal for a temporary truce until the end of 1914. However, given the current situation, I need to make strategic decisions that best serve my interests. Once the situation changes, I might be open to a truce. However, once you are out of the game, I could potentially help you against other threats such as Germany and England.
  From GERMANY: I understand that France has become a significant threat and has captured Naples and Rome from you. A joint plan against France might be necessary, but it needs some more time and coordination with other powers such as Austria and Russia. Once Turkey is neutralized, we might be able to form a broader coalition against France if that seems strategically viable.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that we should make a final push against Turkey this round until it is completely eliminated. Once Turkey is out of the game, we need to address the threat from France. I propose that we make a well-coordinated plan against France once Turkey is neutralized.
  From TURKEY: Given our weakened states, it makes sense for us to make a non-aggression pact until the end of 1914 where both of us make no aggressive moves against each other. What do you think?

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring 1914 Movement phase (S1914M), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it was after the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy. The status quo in terms of supply center distribution was maintained once again."}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring 1914 Movement phase (S1914M), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it was after the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy. The status quo in terms of supply center distribution was maintained once again."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: We need to make a final push against Turkey. Once that is done, we need to make a well-coordinated action against another power such as Russia. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From ENGLAND: Italy, France has become the leading power with 7 supply centers and has captured Naples from you. It might be in our mutual interest to make a plan against France. What specific moves do you propose for a joint action against France?
  From FRANCE: Given your current situation, it might be in your best interest to make a strategic withdrawal and consider a more peaceful exit. Alternatively, you might need to disband your dislodged unit F ION. What are your plans for your dislodged unit in ION?
  From GERMANY: Hello, Italy. I want to make sure that our borders remain peaceful. Given that you have a unit in Venice, what are your intentions? Is there any way we can work together, possibly against France?
  From RUSSIA: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Let us make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out, we need to make a strategic plan for the future.
  From TURKEY: I propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Given that both of us are in a relatively weak position, a non-aggression pact could be mutually beneficial.

  From AUSTRIA: Italy, while I understand your need for a peaceful resolution, our immediate goal is to first neutralize Turkey. Once that is done, we need to make a well-coordinated action plan against other threats such as France. However, for now, a temporary truce might be beneficial until Turkey is out of the game.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I understand that your situation is dire and that France has made significant inroads into your territory. While the balance of power is crucial for us all, I need to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. Once your situation stabilizes, I am open to making a plan against France. Your naval power could make a significant impact as well. Let us make a plan once we stabilize Turkey's situation.
  From FRANCE: While a temporary truce might be considered, it should be on terms that are favorable to both sides. For us to withdraw from Naples and the Ionian Sea, what concessions are you willing to make? A prolonged conflict might indeed make us both vulnerable, so let us find a mutually beneficial agreement.
  From GERMANY: I understand that France is a common enemy for us. However, I need to make sure that any actions we take are well-coordinated. For now, I need to keep a neutral stance until a more concrete plan is made. However, I will keep your request in mind.
  From RUSSIA: I understand that Austria has captured Vienna and Greece and now holds a unit in Trieste. Once Turkey is neutralized, I can put some pressure on Austria so that they need to defend their eastern front. However, for now, our main focus should be on making a final push against Turkey.
  From TURKEY: Italy, we are both in a weakened position. Would you be interested in a joint action plan against a common enemy such as Russia or Austria? Any support against Russia could help us both survive longer.

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring 1914 Movement phase (S1914M), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it was after the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy. The status quo in terms of supply center distribution was maintained once again."}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring 1914 Movement phase (S1914M), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it was after the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy. The status quo in terms of supply center distribution was maintained once again."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1914M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A VEN, F AEG, F TUN
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "GRE"], ["A", "VIE"], ["A", "SER"], ["A", "TRI"]], "ENGLAND": [["A", "LON"], ["F", "BAL"], ["F", "LVP"], ["F", "ENG"], ["F", "NTH"], ["F", "DEN"], ["F", "PIC"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["A", "PIE"], ["F", "BRE"], ["F", "MAO"], ["F", "NAP"], ["A", "MAR"], ["F", "ION"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "BUR"], ["F", "SWE"], ["A", "TYR"], ["A", "RUH"], ["A", "BOH"]], "ITALY": [["A", "VEN"], ["F", "AEG"], ["F", "TUN"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "GAL"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "BLA"], ["F", "STP/NC"], ["A", "ANK"]], "TURKEY": [["A", "SMY"]]}
  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "BUL", "GRE", "SER", "VIE"], "ENGLAND": ["BEL", "DEN", "EDI", "HOL", "LON", "LVP", "NWY"], "FRANCE": ["BRE", "MAR", "NAP", "PAR", "POR", "ROM", "SPA"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "KIE", "MUN", "SWE", "WAR"], "ITALY": ["TRI", "TUN", "VEN"], "RUSSIA": ["ANK", "CON", "MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "STP"], "TURKEY": ["SMY"]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Let's make a temporary truce until Turkey is neutralized. Once that is done, we should make a plan to address other threats such as France or Russia. However, our main goal should still be to make sure that Turkey is completely neutralized first.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, it seems that France is a significant threat now, holding 7 supply centers including Naples which they took from you. Would you be interested in a joint plan against France to curb their expansion?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, it seems that your position is quite weak. I would like to offer a peace proposal where you disband some of your units and cede some of your remaining supply centers. This could help us avoid further bloodshed. What are your thoughts on this?
  From GERMANY: Hello, Italy. Given your current situation, what are your plans for this round? Is there a possibility for us to make a joint action against another power such as France or Austria?
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914 and make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out of the picture, we need to make a strategic plan for the future.
  From TURKEY: I propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Given that we are both in weakened states, would you be interested in a joint action plan against a common enemy such as France or Austria?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I acknowledge the threat posed by France and am willing to make a plan against France once Turkey is neutralized. However, our immediate priority should be to make a final push against Turkey. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I understand that France poses a significant threat to your remaining centers such as Naples and Venice. However, the balance of power is crucial for us all. Right now, the main priority is to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. I am open to future cooperation against any power that becomes a significant threat. However, for now, it seems that a well-coordinated action against France might be a strategic next step once Turkey is neutralized. What specific moves do you have in mind for this round?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I understand your concerns about my unit in NAP. However, we previously agreed on a temporary truce until the end of 1914. I aim to maintain this truce until that time. However, it is important that you understand that France intends to keep Naples and Rome. I suggest that you focus on defending against Austria and Russia while I will not make any aggressive moves until the end of 1914 unless provoked.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against France might indeed be a good idea. However, let us make a more concrete plan once Turkey has been neutralized. For now, let us ensure that our borders remain peaceful and that we keep each other informed of any major strategic moves.
  From RUSSIA: I acknowledge that France is a significant threat. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Once Turkey is neutralized, any support against France could make a significant impact.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I understand that my situation is indeed precarious. A peaceful resolution sounds like a reasonable way forward. What kind of terms are you proposing for a peaceful transition? I am open to making no aggressive moves if it means a graceful exit for me. Could you provide any support against Russia or Austria as part of the deal?

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Winter 1914 Adjustment phase (W1914A), no supply centers changed hands. Consequently, any unit adjustments made by the powers would be based on the supply center distribution from the end of the Fall 1914 Movement phase where Austria successfully captured Trieste from Italy, thus increasing Austria's supply center count while decreasing Italy's. The specific unit builds or disbands for this phase are not specified here, but the ownership of supply centers remains unchanged."}

Phase: S1915M, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Winter 1914 Adjustment phase (W1914A), no supply centers changed hands. Consequently, any unit adjustments made by the powers would be based on the supply center distribution from the end of the Fall 1914 Movement phase where Austria successfully captured Trieste from Italy, thus increasing Austria's supply center count while decreasing Italy's. The specific unit builds or disbands for this phase are not specified here, but the ownership of supply centers remains unchanged."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1915M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A VEN, F AEG

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914 has now expired. However, I believe that once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a plan for a joint action against another power such as France or Russia. However, until Turkey is neutralized, I hope that we can maintain a peaceful stance. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I see that you now only have 2 supply centers. It seems that France has become a more significant threat with 7 supply centers. Are you open to making a plan against France or do you need any assistance? I am open to a temporary alliance if it helps us maintain a balance of power.
  From FRANCE: Hello, Italy. Our temporary truce until the end of 1914 has expired. I propose a new truce for the year 1915 where we maintain peace. However, I need to make it clear that France intends to keep Naples and Rome. If you need support against another power such as Austria or Germany, we could potentially discuss that.
  From GERMANY: Hello Italy, I propose that we extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Given your current situation, I hope that we can maintain peace and avoid any unnecessary conflicts.
  From RUSSIA: Since Turkey is nearly neutralized, what should be our next steps? We need a new strategic plan once Turkey is gone.
  From TURKEY: I propose a 'peaceful surrender' where I make no aggressive moves if you allow me to keep Smyrna until the end of the game phase. Given that we both face significant threats from larger powers, I hope you might find this arrangement acceptable.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I acknowledge your proposal for a non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Supporting you in retaking Rome from France could be a part of a larger plan once Turkey is neutralized. However, keeping Trieste should be part of our strategic discussion for the moment. Let us make a plan where once we retake Rome, we make a joint effort against France.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I cannot agree to withdraw from PIE and NAP or allow you to retake Rome. However, I propose a truce where you focus on other threats such as Austria or Germany while France maintains its current positions. This would help us both focus on other threats.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I acknowledge your defensive intentions for A VEN. I am willing to consider a joint action against France if it is well-coordinated. However, any such action would need to be well-planned and executed.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I agree to make a joint action against Turkey where you aim for Smyrna while I make a move on Bulgaria if necessary. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss further cooperation against other powers such as France or Austria.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I accept your non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. It makes sense for us to avoid conflict and focus on other threats. Given that both of us are in a difficult position, would you be open to a joint action against a common enemy such as France or Austria?

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Spring 1915 Movement phase (S1915M), no supply centers changed hands. The territorial control thus remained the same as it was after the Fall 1914 Movement phase, where Austria had captured Trieste from Italy. The phase passed without any significant changes in the ownership of supply centers."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1915R
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A VEN, F EAS
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "GRE"], ["A", "VIE"], ["A", "TRI"], ["A", "ALB"], ["A", "BUD"]], "ENGLAND": [["A", "LON"], ["F", "BAL"], ["F", "DEN"], ["F", "PIC"], ["F", "IRI"], ["F", "BRE"], ["F", "BEL"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["A", "PIE"], ["F", "NAP"], ["A", "MAR"], ["F", "SPA/NC"], ["F", "TUN"], ["*F", "BRE"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "BUR"], ["F", "SWE"], ["A", "TYR"], ["A", "RUH"], ["A", "BOH"]], "ITALY": [["A", "VEN"], ["F", "EAS"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "GAL"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "BLA"], ["F", "STP/NC"], ["A", "ANK"]], "TURKEY": [["A", "SMY"]]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, our non-aggression pact has been extended until the end of 1915. Once Turkey is neutralized, I believe we should make a plan for a joint action against another power such as France or Russia. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ENGLAND: Italy, I acknowledge your weakened state. France seems to be a significant threat to your remaining centers such as VEN and TUN. Do you need any support against France? A joint plan could be beneficial for us both.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our temporary truce until the end of 1915. However, it should be made clear that Naples and Rome should remain French. Given your current position, it might be worth discussing a potential surrender or a more permanent peace agreement where you agree to disband your remaining units. This could help us both avoid further bloodshed.
  From GERMANY: Given that your unit in Venice is near my unit in Tyrolia, what are your intentions? Italy seems to be in a tough spot, and I hope we can find a way to keep our interactions peaceful.
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once that is done, we need to discuss further cooperation against other powers such as France or Austria. What are your thoughts on our future cooperation once Turkey is out of the game?
  From TURKEY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Let us make no aggressive moves against each other.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. I support your plan to retake Rome from France once Turkey is neutralized. However, any action against France should be well-coordinated. It is important that once Turkey is neutralized, we make sure that our actions are well-coordinated and that Italy does not become a threat once Turkey is out of the game.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I hope our temporary alliance against France still holds. Once Turkey is neutralized, I aim to make a plan to act against France. Your naval support would be crucial for a move on Rome and Naples. Let us make a plan for a coordinated action against France once Turkey is dealt with.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I am willing to keep a temporary truce until the end of 1915. However, I intend to keep control of NAP and PIE until a more stable agreement can be reached. I suggest that you focus on making a last push against Turkey or negotiating with Austria for a peaceful resolution. Any aggressive moves against my units should be avoided to keep the truce valid.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I acknowledge your reassurance that A VEN is for defensive purposes. A joint action against France could indeed be beneficial once Turkey is neutralized. However, any such plan should be well-coordinated and should not leave us vulnerable to other powers such as Austria or Russia. Let us keep in close communication as the situation develops.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I agree that our joint action against Turkey should continue until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out, a joint action against France might make sense. What do you think would be the most advantageous for us?
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. I make no aggressive moves against Italy as long as I keep Smyrna until the end of the game phase.

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Spring 1915 Movement phase (S1915M), no supply centers changed hands. The territorial control thus remained the same as it was after the Fall 1914 Movement phase, where Austria had captured Trieste from Italy. The phase passed without any significant changes in the ownership of supply centers."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1915M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Let's reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a plan for a joint action against another power such as France or Russia. What do you think about making a joint action against France once Turkey is out of the game?
  From ENGLAND: Italy, you currently have only 2 centers and 2 units. France seems like a more immediate threat to you. What are your intentions for this round? Is there any way we can support you against France?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, it seems that Turkey is close to being neutralized. As previously agreed, our non-aggression pact should last until the end of 1915. However, once Turkey is out of the game, our focus might need to shift. I want to make it clear that Naples and Rome should remain under French control. Let us make sure that our units do not make any aggressive moves against each other until the end of 1915.
  From GERMANY: Hello Italy, I would like to verify your intentions given that my army in Tyrolia (A TYR) is near Munich (A MUN) and Bohemia (A BOH). Are your intentions peaceful?
  From RUSSIA: We need to make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out, what are your plans? We should make sure our borders remain secure.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, given our past non-aggression pacts, I propose a peaceful surrender where I make no aggressive moves if you allow me to keep Smyrna until the end of the game phase. I am willing to make any concessions necessary for a peaceful conclusion. Please consider a truce where I make no moves against you.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. However, once Turkey is neutralized, it makes sense to make a well-coordinated action against France. However, we need to make sure that all parties involved are on board with this plan. Let us make sure that once Turkey is out of the game, we make a joint action against France.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I acknowledge your need for naval support against French coasts and am willing to make a plan once Turkey is neutralized. However, the main priority is to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against France could be a priority.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I confirm that we will honor the truce until the end of 1915. However, it should be clear that France intends to keep control of Naples and Rome as part of our defensive strategy. As such, any move to retake Rome would be seen as a breach of the truce.
  From GERMANY: I understand that A VEN is for defensive purposes. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against France could indeed be a strategic next step. Let us make a plan once Turkey is out of the game.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our joint action against Turkey where you aim for Smyrna. Once Turkey is neutralized, a future joint action against France could be a strategic next step. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From TURKEY: Thank you for reaffirming the non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Turkey has no intention of making any aggressive moves against Italy and we will honor this pact.

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"The Fall 1915 Movement phase (F1915M) also did not result in any changes in the ownership of supply centers. The territorial control thus remained the same as it was after the Fall 1914 Movement phase where Austria had captured Trieste from Italy. The phase passed without any significant changes in the ownership of supply centers."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1915R
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A VEN, F EAS
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "GRE"], ["A", "VIE"], ["A", "TRI"], ["A", "ALB"], ["A", "BUD"]], "ENGLAND": [["A", "LON"], ["F", "BAL"], ["F", "DEN"], ["F", "PIC"], ["F", "IRI"], ["F", "BRE"], ["F", "BEL"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["A", "PIE"], ["A", "MAR"], ["F", "SPA/NC"], ["F", "MAO"], ["F", "ROM"], ["F", "ION"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "BUR"], ["F", "SWE"], ["A", "TYR"], ["A", "KIE"], ["A", "MUN"]], "ITALY": [["A", "VEN"], ["F", "EAS"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "GAL"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "BLA"], ["F", "STP/NC"], ["A", "ANK"], ["A", "SMY"]], "TURKEY": [["*A", "SMY"]]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. However, once that ends, it seems like the international situation might make us act differently. However, until then, let us make sure our borders remain peaceful.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, given that you only have two supply centers and France poses a significant threat to your remaining centers (such as Venice and Tunis), it might be in our mutual interest to make a plan against France. What are your thoughts?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, our truce should remain until the end of 1915. However, it is important that you acknowledge that Naples and Rome should remain under French control. Once our truce is over, we need to make a plan for the future.
  From GERMANY: Hello, Italy. Given your current position, what are your plans for the next round? Would you be interested in a non-aggression pact until the end of 1915?
  From RUSSIA: Our non-aggression pact until Turkey is neutralized should still be valid. Once Turkey is out of the game, what are your plans for future cooperation against other powers such as France or Austria?
  From TURKEY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Given that my only unit (A SMY) has been dislodged by Russia, any support or advice you can provide would be appreciated.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I hope all is well. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915 and assure you that I will not make any aggressive moves against Venice until the end of 1915. I am open to making a plan against France once Turkey is neutralized. Let us make a well-coordinated effort against France once Turkey is out of the game.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I understand that France poses a significant threat to your remaining centers such as Naples and Venice. However, the balance of power is crucial for us all. Right now, the main priority is to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. I am open to future cooperation against any power that becomes a significant threat. However, once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a plan together against France.
  From FRANCE: I am willing to make a temporary truce until the end of 1915 where both powers should not make aggressive moves against each other. However, I need to make it clear that France intends to keep control of Rome and Naples. I do not have a unit in NAP, but I do control the NAP supply center. I am not in a position to withdraw from PIE or allow Italy to retake Rome and Naples.
  From GERMANY: I want to reassure you that the army in TYR is for defensive purposes until the end of 1915. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against France could be a viable plan. However, I need to verify this plan with Austria and Russia as well.
  From RUSSIA: Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against France makes sense. However, it makes sense to make a plan against France after making sure that all powers are in agreement. We need a well-coordinated plan that makes sure that no other power grows too strong.
  From TURKEY: Thank you for reaffirming the non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Given that Russia has taken Smyrna, is there any possibility of a joint action against Russia? Any support could be helpful.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Italy, our non-aggression pact has expired after the end of 1915. However, it has been beneficial for us both. I propose renewing our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. Additionally, once Turkey is neutralized, it makes sense for us to make a plan for a joint action against another power such as France or Russia. What are your thoughts?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, given your current situation with only 2 supply centers, what are your plans for this round? Is there any way we could make a plan that benefits us both?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, your position in the game currently seems quite weak. Given that our truce also expired at the end of 1915, I need to know your intentions. I am open to a strategic offer where you agree to disband your remaining units or make a final push where we might allow you to keep Venice and Tunis until the end of the game if you agree to support France. What are your thoughts on this?
  From GERMANY: Hello Italy, I would like to verify your intentions for this round. Given that you only have two supply centers and two units, what are your plans? I want to make sure that any potential threats are addressed.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, given your current position with only two supply centers and two units, it might be wise to make a 'peaceful surrender' or plan for a final push until you are completely neutralized. However, if you are willing to make a strategic retreat, we can discuss a more graceful exit.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. However, I believe that France is a significant threat given that it holds Rome and Naples. However, before making a joint action against France, we need to make sure that our borders are secure. I suggest that we make a well-coordinated plan against another power such as Russia once our borders are secure. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I understand that France seems like a significant threat to you. However, it seems that the main priority now is making a well-coordinated action against the next most significant threat such as Germany. However, if you need any support against France, I am open to discussing a plan where you retake Rome and Naples. What specific moves do you have in mind?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, while I understand your aim to retake Rome and Naples, I must make it clear that France intends to keep control of these centers. However, a temporary truce until the end of 1916 might be useful if it allows us to focus on other threats such as England or Germany. However, any 'peaceful retake' of Rome and Naples is not an option.
  From GERMANY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. However, I need to make a well-coordinated plan with other powers before making a joint action against France. Let us keep our borders secure for now.
  From RUSSIA: I appreciate your proposal to make a joint action against France. However, given the current game state and the need to make strategic moves, I need to make a well-coordinated action against another power. However, I am open to a peaceful surrender where you disband your units and allow us to make a strategic plan against other powers such as France.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916 if that was previously agreed upon. However, once our borders are secure, we should make a plan for a joint action against another power such as France or Russia. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, with only two centers remaining, it seems that you are in a weakened state. However, any support against a major power such as Russia or France could be beneficial for us both. What are your plans for this round?
  From FRANCE: Hello, it seems that your situation is quite difficult with only two units and two supply centers remaining. I propose that you disband your units and surrender. Alternatively, if you do not agree, a coordinated action with Austria and Russia might be necessary to resolve the situation. What are your thoughts on this?
  From GERMANY: Hello, Italy. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. What are your intentions for A TYR near A MUN?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, Turkey has been eliminated. Given your current position with only two supply centers and two units, I propose a peaceful surrender where you disband your units and allow us to make a strategic plan against other powers such as France or Germany. This would make the game more strategic and less chaotic.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. I understand your concern about France holding Rome and Naples. However, I need to make a plan for a well-coordinated action against another power such as France or Russia once our borders are secure. Let us make a plan once we make sure that our borders are secure.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, a joint action against France could be beneficial for us both. However, I need a well-coordinated plan where you make a solid plan and show a willingness to make a coordinated attack on France. What specific moves do you propose for us to make a joint action against France?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I acknowledge your intention to retake Rome and Naples. However, I intend to keep control of these centers. I suggest that you consider a more peaceful resolution such as disbanding units or focusing on other powers such as Austria or Germany. A well-coordinated action against you is being planned by multiple powers, so it might be in your best interest to make a strategic withdrawal.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. I understand your concerns about France holding Rome and Naples, which are rightfully Italian territories. However, our current plans might be focused elsewhere. We need to make a strategic decision based on a broader alliance plan. However, we should keep our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. My main goal now is to make a well-coordinated action against France once Italy is neutralized. However, I understand that your main goal is to retake Rome and Naples from France. Once you have retaken these territories, I am open to discussing further cooperation. What are your thoughts on a joint action against France once you retake Rome and Naples?

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase (W1916A), no supply centers changed ownership. The territorial changes from the Fall 1916 Movement phase (F1916M) were thus finalized, with Germany now holding Holland (gained from England) while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw).}

Propose a joint action against France with Austria, England, and Germany while negotiating a temporary truce with France until the end of 1917 where Italy makes it clear that the goal is to retake Rome and Naples once the truce ends. Additionally, seek assurance from Russia that they won't make aggressive moves against our remaining supply centers."

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase (W1916A), no supply centers changed ownership. The territorial changes from the Fall 1916 Movement phase (F1916M) were thus finalized, with Germany now holding Holland (gained from England) while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw).}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Italy, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916 has expired. I propose a new non-aggression pact until the end of 1917 if you agree to a 'peaceful surrender' where I take VEN and another power takes TUN. If you do not agree, a well-coordinated action against you might be necessary.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, you have been significantly weakened and now hold only 2 supply centers. Given that Russia is the leading power with 8 centers, it might make sense for us to make a joint plan against a common threat such as Russia. What are your thoughts?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, as it stands, your power is significantly weakened. We are offering a final chance for you to surrender or make an agreement where you disband your remaining units and exit the game. Alternatively, any aggressive action from your side will be met with a strong response.
  From GERMANY: Hello, Italy. I suggest we extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Could you also explain what your plans are for your unit in TYR?
  From RUSSIA: It seems that your situation is quite difficult. We need to make a plan for a peaceful surrender where you disband your units and allow us to make a strategic plan against other powers such as France and Germany.

  From AUSTRIA: I acknowledge your proposal to continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. However, for strategic reasons, I need to make a move on Venice (VEN). Once Italy is neutralized, I would be open to a 'peaceful surrender' where I take VEN and another power takes TUN. However, a joint action against France might be a plan for after Italy is neutralized.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, a joint plan against France makes sense once Italy is sufficiently weakened and we make sure that Russia's power is checked. However, France is a significant power and a coordinated attack might make sense. What specific moves do you suggest for retaking Rome and Naples?
  From FRANCE: I cannot accept a truce where you aim to retake Rome and Naples, as these are now part of France. However, I offer a truce where you surrender and disband your remaining units to avoid further bloodshed.
  From GERMANY: I agree to continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. However, any joint action against France would need to be well-planned and coordinated. Let us discuss a more detailed plan later.
  From RUSSIA: I agree to continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. However, once Italy is neutralized, a new plan should be made where you might need to make a 'peaceful surrender' if it makes strategic sense for us. I hope you understand.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Spring 1917 Movement phase (S1917M) did not result in any changes in supply center ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was after the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase (W1916A), where Germany gained Holland from England while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw).}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Spring 1917 Movement phase (S1917M) did not result in any changes in supply center ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was after the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase (W1916A), where Germany gained Holland from England while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw).}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1917R
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: F TYS, A ROM
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "VIE"], ["A", "ALB"], ["A", "BUD"], ["A", "SER"], ["A", "VEN"]], "ENGLAND": [["A", "LON"], ["F", "BAL"], ["F", "PIC"], ["F", "BRE"], ["F", "BEL"], ["F", "EDI"], ["F", "SWE"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["A", "MAR"], ["F", "SPA/NC"], ["F", "MAO"], ["F", "NAP"], ["A", "TUS"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "BUR"], ["A", "HOL"], ["A", "RUH"], ["A", "PIE"], ["*F", "SWE"]], "ITALY": [["F", "TYS"], ["A", "ROM"]], "RUSSIA": [["F", "BLA"], ["F", "STP/NC"], ["A", "ANK"], ["A", "WAR"], ["A", "ARM"], ["F", "RUM"], ["A", "MOS"], ["A", "BOH"]], "TURKEY": []}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: We acknowledge our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. However, we need to make a move on Venice (VEN) for strategic reasons. We need to make sure that our borders are secure. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ENGLAND: Italy, Russia has become the leading power with 8 centers. It might make sense for us to make a temporary alliance against Russia or any other power that seems to be growing too strong. What are your intentions for the next round?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, it seems that your situation is dire. I offer you a final chance to surrender. Any resistance will be met with a coordinated action from France, Austria, and possibly Russia. It would be in your best interest to disband your remaining units and make a peaceful exit from the game.
  From GERMANY: Hello Italy, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. What are your plans for the next round? Do you need any support from us?
  From RUSSIA: We propose a peaceful surrender where you disband your units and allow us to make a strategic plan against other powers such as France and Germany.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I understand your concern about units in VEN and ROM. However, our current plan is to make a final push against Italy until it is completely neutralized. Once Italy is out of the game, a plan against another major power such as France or Russia could be made, but the immediate priority is to make sure Italy is neutralized.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, I acknowledge your plan against Russia until it is weakened and your intention to turn against France to retake Rome and Naples. However, our main priority is to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. Once Italy is neutralized, the next major threat should be identified. What specific moves do you propose for this round?
  From FRANCE: I agree to a temporary truce until the end of 1917 where I make no aggressive moves towards Rome. However, any aggressive moves by you towards Rome or Naples will be met with a strong response. It would be beneficial for us both to keep the peace until the end of 1917.
  From GERMANY: We agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. We will not make any aggressive moves towards Rome from PIE. However, once Russia is weakened, a plan against France could make sense for us both.
  From RUSSIA: Unfortunately, a non-aggression pact until the end of 1917 is not feasible. Our goal is to make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is neutralized. However, if you make a peaceful surrender where you disband your units, it would make a strategic plan against other powers such as France and Germany easier.

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1917 Retreat phase (S1917R), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was after the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase where Germany gained Holland from England while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw). The retreat phase did not result in any new unit movements or dislodgments, thus maintaining the status quo established in the previous movement phase.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1917 Retreat phase (S1917R), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was after the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase where Germany gained Holland from England while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw). The retreat phase did not result in any new unit movements or dislodgments, thus maintaining the status quo established in the previous movement phase.}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, the current plan is to make a final push against you until you are neutralized. However, if you are willing to make a 'peaceful surrender' where you make no aggressive moves and allow us to make a coordinated plan against another power such as Russia, that could be a strategic exit for you.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, Russia is now the leading power with 8 supply centers. It might be in our mutual interest to make a plan against Russia to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb Russia's expansion?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, given your current situation with only two supply centers and two units, I offer you a final chance to surrender or make a strategic withdrawal. It might be in your best interest to make a strategic decision now.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I need to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Given that you only have two supply centers left (TUN and VEN), what are your plans? I need to make sure that our pact remains valid and that there is no threat from your units towards my unit in Piedmont (PIE).
  From RUSSIA: We need to make a well-coordinated action until Italy is neutralized. A peaceful surrender where Italy disbands its units might be a strategic option.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I acknowledge your proposal for a non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. However, the current plan is to make a final push against Italy until it is neutralized unless you make a 'peaceful surrender' and give up your remaining supply centers.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, we are currently focusing on the 'Northern Triple' alliance which requires us to make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is neutralized. Once Italy is neutralized, a plan should be made to act against France. However, if Italy is willing to make a joint plan against Russia once Italy is neutralized, I am open to that.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, given your weak position, a non-aggression pact until the end of 1917 might make sense. However, I need to make a plan based on the overall game state. We need to make a plan once Italy is neutralized.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Let us make sure that our units do not conflict. However, my A PIE might need to make a move that could be seen as a defensive action.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, given your current weak position, a non-aggression pact until the end of 1917 is not in our best interest. However, a peaceful surrender where you disband your units could be a more strategic option. This would allow us to make a strategic plan against other powers such as France and Germany.

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Winter 1917 Adjustment phase (W1917A), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers remained as it was at the end of the Fall 1917 Movement phase. Thus, England still holds the additional center of Sweden, which it captured from Germany. Italy retains control of Rome, which it took from France, while Austria still holds Venice, which it captured from Italy. The net result is that England has gained one center (Sweden), Austria has gained one center (Venice), Italy has a net change of zero centers (gaining Rome but losing Venice), France has lost one center (Rome), and Germany has lost one center (Sweden).}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Winter 1917 Adjustment phase (W1917A), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers remained as it was at the end of the Fall 1917 Movement phase. Thus, England still holds the additional center of Sweden, which it captured from Germany. Italy retains control of Rome, which it took from France, while Austria still holds Venice, which it captured from Italy. The net result is that England has gained one center (Sweden), Austria has gained one center (Venice), Italy has a net change of zero centers (gaining Rome but losing Venice), France has lost one center (Rome), and Germany has lost one center (Sweden).}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1918M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Italy, it seems that your situation is precarious. I need to make a well-coordinated action against you until you are neutralized. However, if you make a 'peaceful surrender' and disband your units, it might make the process smoother for all involved.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, it seems that your situation is dire with only two supply centers and two units left. We suggest that you surrender and disband your units. If you refuse, we will make a coordinated attack with Russia and Austria to ensure your complete elimination. It's time to make a wise decision.
  From GERMANY: Hello Italy, I propose that we extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Given your current position, what are your plans for this round?
  From RUSSIA: It looks like your situation is quite challenging. A peaceful surrender might be the best option for you at this point. What are your thoughts? If you need a graceful exit, we could make a plan where you disband your units.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1918M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, while I appreciate your offer for a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918, the current situation demands that any plan be made once the immediate threats are neutralized. We need to make a plan once Italy is out of the picture.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, I understand your precarious position. However, our main priority is to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. Once Italy is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Russia might make sense given their dominant position. However, for now, a well-coordinated action against Italy seems to be the main priority for most powers.
  From FRANCE: Italy, while a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918 might be beneficial for us both, your current position makes such a pact seem like a ploy to buy time. However, if you are open to a more strategic surrender where you disband your units and make a more peaceful exit, we could consider such an agreement. However, any non-aggression pact should not prevent us from making a well-coordinated action against you if necessary.
  From GERMANY: I agree to a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. I understand that you aim to retake lost territories such as Venice from Austria. I wish you success in that endeavor.
  From RUSSIA: Italy, I understand your precarious position. However, it seems like you need a well-coordinated action against France and Austria. Unfortunately, a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918 might be the best I can do. However, I can't make any promises regarding support against Austria or France as many powers are already making plans against you. Perhaps a peaceful surrender might make the situation more stable for everyone.

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1918 Movement phase (S1918M), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was at the end of the Winter 1917 Adjustment phase. England still holds Sweden (which it captured from Germany), Italy still holds Rome (which it captured from France), and Austria still holds Venice (which it captured from Italy). The net result is that England has one additional center (Sweden), Austria has one additional center (Venice), Italy has a net change of zero centers (gaining Rome but losing Venice), France has lost one center (Rome), and Germany has lost one center (Sweden).}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1918 Movement phase (S1918M), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was at the end of the Winter 1917 Adjustment phase. England still holds Sweden (which it captured from Germany), Italy still holds Rome (which it captured from France), and Austria still holds Venice (which it captured from Italy). The net result is that England has one additional center (Sweden), Austria has one additional center (Venice), Italy has a net change of zero centers (gaining Rome but losing Venice), France has lost one center (Rome), and Germany has lost one center (Sweden).}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Italy, given your current weakened state, what are your plans for the future? It is important to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. Russia now has 8 supply centers and 8 units. What are your thoughts on a plan to make sure that Russia does not expand further?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, capturing Rome was a significant act of aggression. I need a safe retreat for my unit `*A ROM` to `APU`. If you want a temporary truce until the end of 1918, allow this retreat. Otherwise, France will make a coordinated effort with Russia and Austria to completely eliminate you.
  From GERMANY: Hello, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Let us continue our peaceful relations.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Italy, it seems that your position is quite difficult. We need to make a well-coordinated action until you are neutralized. However, once that happens, what are your thoughts on a strategic plan for the remaining powers?

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1918R
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I acknowledge your proposal for a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. However, the main goal for us is still to make sure that Italy is neutralized. Once that is done, we can make a plan for future actions.
  From ENGLAND: I acknowledge your request for a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Any support against France could be mutually beneficial once Italy is neutralized. However, our main focus should be on making sure that no single power becomes too dominant.
  From FRANCE: We propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918 as well. However, it makes sense for us to keep control of Rome and Naples. Given that you only have one supply center left (Tun), it makes sense for you to disband the dislodged unit in Rome unless you have a viable retreat option such as Apulia (APU).
  From GERMANY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Let us make sure we avoid any conflicts.
  From RUSSIA: I acknowledge your proposal for a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. However, given that Italy is on the verge of elimination, it makes sense for us to make a final push until Italy is completely neutralized. However, we need to make sure that our units are positioned strategically.

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1918 Retreat phase (S1918R), any dislodged units from the Spring 1918 Movement phase made necessary retreats or were disbanded if no valid retreat options were available. However, no supply center ownership changes occurred during this phase.}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1918M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: F TYS, A APU
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "VIE"], ["A", "BUD"], ["A", "VEN"], ["A", "TRI"], ["A", "ALB"]], "ENGLAND": [["A", "LON"], ["F", "BRE"], ["F", "BEL"], ["F", "NTH"], ["F", "EDI"], ["F", "KIE"], ["F", "ENG"], ["F", "DEN"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["A", "MAR"], ["F", "SPA/NC"], ["F", "NAP"], ["A", "ROM"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "BUR"], ["A", "HOL"], ["A", "MUN"], ["A", "TUS"]], "ITALY": [["F", "TYS"], ["A", "APU"]], "RUSSIA": [["F", "BLA"], ["F", "STP/NC"], ["A", "ANK"], ["A", "ARM"], ["F", "RUM"], ["A", "MOS"], ["A", "GAL"], ["A", "TYR"]], "TURKEY": []}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: It seems that you are on the verge of being eliminated. If you make a peaceful surrender now, it might save us all some time and resources. Otherwise, a well-coordinated action against you will continue until you are neutralized.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, it seems that your position is now quite precarious. I suggest you make a last stand or seek a safe haven until the game ends. If there is any way we can help you make a dignified exit, let us know.
  From FRANCE: It seems that your situation is dire. We propose that you make a strategic withdrawal and disband your remaining units. Any aggressive moves on your part will be met with a coordinated response from us and our allies.
  From GERMANY: Hello, Italy. I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Do you agree? Given your current position, what are your plans for the next round?
  From RUSSIA: It seems that your situation is quite difficult. We propose a peaceful surrender where you disband your units so that we can make a strategic plan against other powers such as France and Germany.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1918M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Given the current situation, it makes sense for us to make a well-coordinated action against another major power such as Russia once Italy is neutralized. However, our main goal now is to make sure that Italy is completely neutralized first. However, if you make a peaceful surrender, we can make a plan for a joint action against another major power such as France or Russia.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, I understand your need for support against France. However, the main goal is to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. Once Italy is neutralized, a plan against France might make sense. However, for now, the main priority is to make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is neutralized.
  From FRANCE: Italy, your proposal to withdraw from Rome and Naples is not acceptable. You are significantly weakened and should be neutralized first. However, if you are willing to surrender or make a significant concession such as disbanding your units, a truce could be considered.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. However, I must make strategic decisions based on the alliances formed previously with England and Austria.
  From RUSSIA: I agree to a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918 so that you can focus on retaking Rome and Naples from France. However, make sure that this does not hinder our plan to make a final push against Italy if necessary.

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}
