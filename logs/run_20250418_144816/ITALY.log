Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I confirm our non-aggression pact where you focus on the Mediterranean while I focus on the Balkans. I plan to secure Serbia and possibly move towards Greece. Can you ensure that your fleet in ION does not move into the Adriatic Sea or towards Greece?
  From FRANCE: I confirm our non-aggression pact. I plan to focus on the west, which might involve a potential conflict with England or Germany. I suggest that you focus on the Mediterranean and possibly the Balkans while I handle the west. Do you have any specific plans for the Mediterranean that might require any form of indirect support or coordination from me?
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I agree that a non-aggression pact can benefit us both by allowing us to focus on our immediate neighbors. My plans for this round are to ensure peaceful borders while focusing on my immediate neighbors such as France and Russia. I hope we can maintain a peaceful border and perhaps coordinate if an opportunity arises against a common threat.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I confirm our non-aggression pact. I plan to focus on the Black Sea and Armenia while you focus on the Western Mediterranean. My plan for this round is to move A SMY to CON and A BUL to either SER or GRE. Let us keep our communication open and avoid any early conflict.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. I am open to discussing a coordinated action against Turkey. However, it's important that any plan we make ensures that our mutual non-aggression remains intact. For instance, if you could focus on supporting any potential move against Turkey from the south while I focus on the north, that might be a viable strategy. However, I need assurances that your units won't make any moves towards Tyrolia or Trieste.
  From FRANCE: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. For further cooperation in the Mediterranean, I suggest that you focus on the eastern part while I focus on the western part. Perhaps you could consider moving your F TUN to the Ionian Sea while I keep my F MAO in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean. This way, we can both expand our influence in the Mediterranean without clashing.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and am interested in a coordinated action against Turkey. I suggest that you make moves against Turkey's supply centers such as Smyrna while I make moves against Bulgaria and Constantinople. Let us make sure that Turkey does not make any gains in the Balkans.
  From TURKEY: I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A coordinated action against Austria sounds beneficial for both of us. I suggest that you move your A TYR to put pressure on Vienna or Budapest, while I focus on Serbia. I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. This way, we can make a two-pronged attack on Austria. What do you think of this plan?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. It would be mutually beneficial if you could support our actions against Turkey. One such action could be if your unit F ION supports our unit F AEG in a potential attack on Smyrna. Are you open to this?
  From FRANCE: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I am interested in a joint action against Austria if it does not conflict with our main focus on Germany. However, our main focus is on Germany. If you make a specific plan for attacking Austria, let me know what kind of support you need from France. However, any support should be carefully coordinated so that it does not weaken our position against Germany.
  From GERMANY: Our non-aggression pact remains valid. I hope we can continue to maintain peace and cooperation. Your unit in TYR makes me a bit cautious, so let us make sure our borders remain peaceful.
  From TURKEY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. Given that you are open to discussing strategic moves, do you plan any actions against Austria such as moving A TYR to VIE or BUD? Coordinating our actions could be mutually beneficial.

Given that no supply centers changed hands in the last round, I suggest that we continue to focus on our respective areas of interest. I am currently focused on the Balkans and would appreciate if you could make sure that your units do not make any aggressive moves towards my territories such as Trieste or Budapest.

  From GERMANY: Hello Italy. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and want to make sure our borders remain peaceful. I need to focus on my issues with France and Russia for now. However, if you have any plans that might require mutual coordination, such as a joint action against France or Russia, please let me know.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and our need for coordinated action against Turkey where you make moves against Smyrna while I make moves against Bulgaria and Constantinople. However, I am a bit concerned about your unit in Vienna. What are your intentions regarding Austria? We need a clear plan for Spring 1903.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I am glad that our non-aggression pact stands firm. Given that you now hold Vienna, what are your plans for the next round?

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

  From AUSTRIA: Hello, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. Given that your units are in VIE and TRI, close to my units in BUD and SER, could you share your intentions for this season? I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact and suggest a joint action against Germany. Given your unit in Vienna (A VIE), a joint action against Munich (A MUN) could be a viable plan where you move A VIE to Tyrolia (TYR) and potentially support my unit in Burgundy (A BUR) to move into Munich. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Could you let me know your intentions for A VIE and A TRI? I want to make sure that our focus remains on our mutual agreements and that any actions taken do not violate our agreement.
  From RUSSIA: Italy, let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and coordinated action against Turkey where you make moves against Smyrna while I make moves against Bulgaria and Constantinople. However, what are your plans for A VIE this turn?
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, it seems that you have made significant gains against Austria by capturing VIE and TRI. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and suggest that we continue to work together to eliminate Austria completely. I plan to move A BUL to SER and possibly A CON to support that move. Could you make a move against Austria's remaining supply center in GRE? For instance, if you move F GRE to AEG (if you have a fleet there) or make a move from A VIE or A TRI to support any of our moves against SER or GRE, that would be helpful. What are your thoughts on this plan?

Could you please provide a more specific plan for these units? I want to make sure that our non-aggression pact is respected and that we maintain open communication.
  From FRANCE: Hello, Italy. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I suggest that you focus on Austria and Turkey while I focus on Germany and England. For any support in the Mediterranean, I can keep F MAO in place to make sure our western Mediterranean remains secure and free of conflict. If you need any other support, let me know.
  From GERMANY: Hello, Italy. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. At the moment, I need to ensure that our borders remain secure. Do you have any specific plans for your units in VIE and TRI that could help us in mutual defense against Russia or Austria? It would be beneficial for us to keep our communication lines open and make sure there is no conflict in the Tyrolia region.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm the non-aggression pact until 1905. I am interested in a joint action against Turkey. F RUM could support any Italian moves from NAP to ION if Italy makes a move to support F RUM in case of a Turkish attack.
  From TURKEY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. I agree that any troop movements should be seen as part of a defensive plan unless we agree on a mutual action against another power. Are you planning any moves against Austria that might require my support? For instance, any actions on BUD or GRE? Let us keep our lines of communication open.

Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json

  From AUSTRIA: We previously agreed to a non-aggression pact until 1905 where you focus on the Mediterranean while I focus on the Balkans. However, your units in Vienna and Trieste are close to my units in Budapest and Serbia. Could you please reassure me that you intend to maintain our non-aggression pact and that these units are not a threat to me? We need to make sure that our pact is still in place and that our borders remain peaceful.
  From ENGLAND: Hello, Italy. I would like to understand your current intentions and see if there is any potential for us to work together. What are your main goals for the next round?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. It makes sense for us to keep peace in the Western Mediterranean while you focus on Austria or Turkey. What are your plans for the next round?
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I hope that you do not make any moves towards Germany's territories such as Munich or Tyrolia. Let us focus on our immediate neighbors such as France and Austria.
  From RUSSIA: Hello, it seems that no new center ownership changes occurred in the Spring 1903 Movement phase. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. How did our joint action against Turkey go? What should be our next steps for Fall 1903?
  From TURKEY: It seems you have successfully captured Vienna from Austria. Congratulations on the progress. I am reaffirming our non-aggression pact where we agreed that you focus on the Western Mediterranean while I focus on the Black Sea and Armenia. However, now that Austria only holds BUD, GRE, and SER, I would like to propose a joint action where we might divide Austria's remaining centers. I plan to make a move on Serbia or Greece. Could we coordinate such that we do not conflict and make a plan for dividing the remaining centers?

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. A joint action against Turkey makes sense. I propose that your fleet in ADR could support my move from A SER to BUL (A SER -> BUL supported by F ADR), while my fleet in GRE moves to the Aegean Sea (F GRE -> AEG) to threaten Smyrna or Constantinople. I believe this plan could help us make significant gains against Turkey this fall. However, please make sure that any troop movements are purely defensive unless a mutual action against Turkey is decided upon.
  From FRANCE: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A joint action against Austria could be beneficial. However, we need to make sure that any such action does not weaken our main focus on Germany. How do you propose we coordinate against Austria?
  From GERMANY: I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. We should make sure that our borders remain peaceful. I hope that we can continue to respect each other’s interests and keep the peace in central Europe.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and am interested in a joint action against Turkey. I could use your support in moving into Bulgaria or Constantinople while I can support your movements into Serbia or Greece. However, I need to make sure that our actions are well-coordinated.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I am indeed interested in joint actions against Austria. Given that you have units in VIE and TRI, could you make a move on BUD while I aim for SER or GRE? A coordinated attack could help us both gain a supply center from Austria.

  From AUSTRIA: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Can you confirm that your units in VIE and TRI will not make any aggressive moves against BUD or SER? Our main focus should still be on countering Turkey.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I want to confirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. If you are open to a cooperative stance in the Mediterranean, I suggest that we could make a joint action against another power such as Austria or Turkey. This would allow you to focus on the Balkans while I focus on Northern Europe.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Make sure that you do not make any aggressive moves against Germany. I propose that you focus on France and Austria while I focus on Russia and England.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905 and plan a joint action against Turkey. I suggest that you support moves into Bulgaria or Constantinople while I support you in Serbia or Greece. What are your thoughts on this plan for the Fall 1903 movement phase?
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. It seems that Austria is on the brink of elimination. How do you plan to proceed against Austria's remaining centers (BUD, GRE, SER)? I am planning to make a move on Serbia. Can we make sure that our actions are coordinated so that we do not conflict?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Our main focus is on the Balkans and Turkey such that troop movements should be seen as part of a defensive plan unless a mutual action against another power is decided. Please make sure that your units in VIE and TRI do not make any threatening moves towards BUD or SER. We need to trust each other for mutual support if another power makes an aggressive move.
  From FRANCE: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given our strong position, I am interested in coordinating actions against Germany. I plan to make a move on BUR with A PAR. Could you make a move against Austria such as A VIE to BUD or A TRI to BUD? Additionally, any cooperation in the Mediterranean should be focused on containing Turkey.
  From GERMANY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. It is important for us to make sure that our strategic positioning does not cause any misunderstandings. At the moment, France appears to be a growing power and a potential threat. Any support you can provide by making moves against France could be mutually beneficial. What are your thoughts?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A joint action against Turkey makes sense. A UKR could support any moves you make against Turkey such as A VEN -> BUL. What are your specific plans for this round?
  From TURKEY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. For the next round, I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON and A UKR (if Russia agrees). F BLA will move to AEG to prepare for a potential move on GRE. It would be helpful if you could focus on BUD or support us in taking SER or GRE if possible. What are your thoughts on this plan?

You are ITALY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"The Fall 1903 movement phase concluded without any centers changing ownership such that the game state remained stable with no new supply center captures."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. However, I need reassurance about the intentions for your units in TRI and BOH. Could you please clarify your plans for these units? Additionally, I suggest that we continue our joint action against Turkey where you could support our efforts in the Balkans or help in capturing Constantinople or Smyrna. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I see that you have a significant military presence and six supply centers. What are your intentions for the next year? Is there potential for us to cooperate against France or Germany?
  From FRANCE: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 is still important. I see that you have a strong position in the Balkans. Perhaps we could cooperate against Austria or Turkey if that aligns with your plans.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. I am concerned about your unit in A TYR which could potentially threaten MUN. I request that you do not make a move on MUN and instead focus on other regions such as Austria or Turkey. Let us maintain our peaceful relations.
  From RUSSIA: ITALY, I see that you have units in TRI and ALB. What are your intentions in the Balkans? Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and continue our joint action against Turkey. What is your plan for the next moves against Turkey?
  From TURKEY: The situation with Austria is still precarious for them. What are your plans for Austria's remaining centers such as BUD and GRE? I aim to focus on SER and GRE. It would make sense for us to coordinate so that you aim for BUD while I aim for SER and GRE. Do you agree with this plan for the next round? We need to make sure that our non-aggression pact holds firm.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I am indeed interested in a joint action against Turkey. It seems that Turkey is a mutual threat. I suggest that your F ION could support my F AEG for a potential move to Smyrna or support an attack on Constantinople. Let us work together to eliminate the Turkish threat.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I am indeed interested in a joint action against Germany. However, it is important that we make sure our actions are well-coordinated. I plan to make a move such as A PAR to BUR. Could you make a move such as A BOH to MUN to put pressure on Germany from the south? However, make sure that our non-aggression pact remains intact.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. To strengthen our alliance, I am interested in joint actions against France or Russia. However, it is important that we make sure there are no aggressive moves towards my territories such as Munich or Burgundy. What specific joint actions do you have in mind?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and am willing to consider a joint action against Turkey. I propose that you aim for Greece and Serbia while I aim for Constantinople and Ankara. Once Turkey is sufficiently weakened, a joint action against Austria could be considered where you make a move from the west while I make a move from the east. Let us make sure our cooperation is fruitful.
  From TURKEY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact as well. I am open to joint action against Austria. My A BUL was dislodged and will likely retreat to GRE. I plan to make moves towards capturing GRE and possibly SER next round. Meanwhile, could you aim for BUD to divide Austria's remaining centers between us?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I need reassurance regarding your A TRI and A TYR units close to my centers. Should we also consider a joint action against Turkey or perhaps a new threat, such as France, who now has 9 supply centers?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, France has grown very strong and now holds 8 supply centers. This makes them a significant threat to all of us. I am interested in forming an alliance with you to curb France's expansion. What are your thoughts on this? How can we collaborate to make a concerted effort against France?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I wish to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. While I focus on Germany, I suggest that you make a move against Austria or Turkey. This could help us both to expand our influence while keeping our borders peaceful.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I want to make sure that our non-aggression pact stands strong. However, I need to verify your intentions regarding A TYR which borders A MUN. Can you assure me that you are not planning any aggressive moves against Munich?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Given Turkey's weakened state, what are your plans in the Balkans? Perhaps a joint action against Turkey could be mutually beneficial.

Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Your plan to work together against Turkey makes sense. However, instead of moving A BUD to SER, I think it might be more strategic for A BUD to stay in BUD for now to provide a defensive position against any potential threats. However, if you could support A BUL to hold or make a move on Greece, that could be a more direct action against Turkey. For the fleet, I suggest that F ION could support F AEG to move to SMY or CON. What do you think about this plan?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I appreciate your reaffirmation of the non-aggression pact until 1905. Given that France is growing stronger, I am open to future cooperation against France once your situation with Turkey is stabilized. Let us keep in touch and plan for a future alliance against France.
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I support your focus on Turkey and would be open to providing support if needed. However, if you are also open to a coordinated action against Germany, I would be interested in discussing a plan where we pressure Germany from both the west (France) and the south (Italy). What are your thoughts on this?
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I understand that A TYR is there for defensive purposes only and appreciate your peaceful intentions. Given that France has grown very strong, would you consider a joint action against France? Any support from your part could help us all.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I agree to support a joint action against Turkey where A UKR could make a move to support SEV if necessary while F RUM should remain in RUM to hold against any Turkish moves. Let us make a coordinated effort against Turkey.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I am glad that you reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. To address your concerns about a defined border, I propose that Turkey agrees not to move into Albania or the Ionian Sea while Italy agrees not to make any moves into Greece or the Aegean Sea. Thus, Turkey will focus on Bulgaria and Serbia while Italy focuses on the Western Mediterranean and Central Europe. Does this sound agreeable? Furthermore, a joint effort against Austria could still be beneficial where you aim for Budapest while we aim for Bulgaria and Serbia.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My units are primarily focused on neutralizing Turkey. I need reassurance that your units in VIE and TYR are not intended for any aggressive moves against me. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss our next steps.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, France now has 8 supply centers and is the most powerful player on the board. We need to curb their expansion. Would you be interested in an alliance against France? What plans do you have to counter their dominance?
  From FRANCE: Hello, our non-aggression pact until 1905 should still hold. We suggest that you focus on Austria or Turkey. If A BOH could support us in a coordinated action against Germany, that would be beneficial for us both.
  From GERMANY: Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I am concerned about your units in BOH and TYR which border MUN. What are your intentions? I suggest that you focus on France and Austria while I focus on Russia.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. It seems that we have dislodged Austria from Bulgaria and plan to hold it securely. Our defined borders still stand where Turkey avoids Albania and ION while Italy avoids GRE and AEG. How do you plan to proceed against Austria's remaining centers like BUD?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. However, it seems there is a misunderstanding: Turkey no longer has a unit in Bulgaria. We have successfully captured BUL and have a unit stationed there. To continue our joint action against Turkey, I suggest that you make a move on Smyrna while I hold BUL and potentially make a move towards Greece or Constantinople. How do you see this plan?
  From ENGLAND: Hello, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Once your situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to cooperating against France. Any support against France would be appreciated if it aligns with my plans. Please keep me informed about your progress in the south.
  From FRANCE: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I support your focus on Turkey this round. However, if you are open to a joint action against Austria, I suggest that we make a coordinated attack on Austria's supply centers such as BUD or SER. For instance, my A MAR could move to PIE and support your A TYR to VEN if you make a move on BUD. What do you think?
  From GERMANY: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905 and understand that A TYR is for defensive purposes. However, France has grown too powerful with 8 supply centers. It might be beneficial for us to keep an eye on France's growing power and consider a joint effort against France if necessary.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I agree to a joint action against Turkey where F RUM could support F ION to move to AEG and attack Smyrna. Alternatively, if you could support my actions against Turkey's unit in Bulgaria, that would be helpful.
  From TURKEY: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I agree that focusing on Austria makes sense. Since we need to make our borders secure, I plan to make no aggressive moves against Italy. However, Austria still has supply centers in BUD and SER. Do you plan to make a move on BUD? I am considering a move on SER. Let us make sure that our borders remain secure and that we continue to work to eliminate any remaining Austrian influence.

Do you have any plans against Turkey where we could coordinate? For instance, if you have any units that could support us in the region or make a move against Turkey's remaining units.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, France has become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. Given that you have 6 supply centers, it might be in our mutual interest to form an alliance against France. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb France's expansion?
  From FRANCE: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 still stands. How should we cooperate further? Should we make a joint action against Austria or Turkey?
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I hope our non-aggression pact is still in place. I noticed your army in TYR. Could you confirm that you have no aggressive intentions towards MUN? What are your plans for the upcoming moves phase?
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. F RUM could support F ION to move to AEG and attack Smyrna. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss any potential actions against Austria.
  From TURKEY: Let us continue our non-aggression pact until 1905. I plan to focus on BUL and SER while you might want to focus on BUD. Let us make sure our actions are coordinated so that we can effectively dismantle Austria.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. For a joint action against Turkey, I already have a fleet in Smyrna (F SMY), so your proposal to make a move on Smyrna might need a bit of a rethink. Instead, I propose that you support my A SER to GRE while I make a move on Constantinople with my F SMY. Another option could be that you support F SMY to CON if you need to make a move on Smyrna yourself. However, it makes more sense for us to work together where I aim for Greece and Constantinople while you make a move on Smyrna or support me in those areas.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I agree that once you resolve your situation with Turkey, a joint plan against France would be beneficial. France has become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. Let us make a plan to curb France's expansion once you are ready. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan against France?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I agree to continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. I support your focus on resolving the Turkey situation. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss a joint plan against Germany or Austria.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. I understand that your A TYR unit is for defensive purposes. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to discussing future strategic plans such as a potential joint action against Austria or France.
  From RUSSIA: We agree to maintain our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. A joint action against Turkey sounds good. F RUM could support F ION to move to AEG and attack Smyrna. Let us make a coordinated effort to neutralize Turkey.
  From TURKEY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. My main focus is on eliminating Austria and recapturing SMY from the Austrian fleet. I have no aggressive intentions towards you. However, I need to make moves against Austria such as targeting A BUD and A SER. I hope you understand that any actions I take against Austria should not be seen as a threat to Italy. Let us continue to work together to ensure a stable Balkans.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, we have a non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. I hope we can respect this agreement until the current year ends. However, what are your intentions for your units in VIE and TRI? We need to make sure that our borders remain peaceful. I suggest that you focus on other fronts such as France or Germany while we focus on neutralizing Turkey.
  From ENGLAND: Italy, France has now become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. We need to make a coordinated plan to curb their expansion. How can we work together against France this round? What are your plans for Spring 1905 moves?
  From FRANCE: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 should still hold. However, I am interested in your plans for A BOH and A TYR. Perhaps a coordinated action against Germany could be beneficial for both of us.
  From GERMANY: Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, the presence of your A TYR and A BOH makes me concerned about potential threats to Munich. Can you provide reassurance that you have no aggressive intentions towards my home centers? Let us make sure that our borders are respected.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I hope you are well. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Given the current situation, I propose a joint action against Turkey where your F AEG could make a move to support an attack on Smyrna or Bulgaria. What are your plans for the next round, and how can I support you further?
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I hope our non-aggression pact until 1905 still stands. Given that Austria still holds BUD, SER, and SMY, I propose that we continue our joint efforts against Austria. I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON and aim to recapture SMY. What are your plans for this round? Do you intend to make any moves against BUD or SER?

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1905M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Italy, I appreciate your proposal to continue our joint action against Turkey. However, I already hold Smyrna (F SMY), so supporting your F AEG to move to Smyrna seems incorrect. Instead, I propose that your F AEG supports my F SMY to move to CON or that your F AEG itself moves to CON while I support my A SER to move to BUL. Another option could be that your F AEG supports a potential A SER move to GRE if that makes strategic sense for us. What do you think?
  From ENGLAND: I understand that your main focus is on resolving the situation with Turkey for now. Once that is done, I am eager for future cooperation against France. Curbing France's power is a priority once you are ready to join the effort. Let us keep in touch.
  From FRANCE: Italy, I acknowledge the reaffirmation of our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. Our main focus is on the situation with Germany. I support your focus on Turkey and am willing to cooperate where our interests align. Please keep me informed of your actions against Turkey as it could help us both achieve our goals.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I acknowledge your defensive stance and reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I need to make sure that A TYR does not make any aggressive moves towards MUN. Let us keep our borders secure while you focus on the situation in the south against Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I agree that we should keep up the pressure on Turkey. F RUM could move to BLA to keep pressure on Constantinople. Make sure that you and Austria coordinate well so that F AEG can successfully move to Smyrna with support from Austria. A GAL could also be used to make a move against Turkey if needed.
  From TURKEY: I appreciate the reaffirmation of our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. However, could you clarify what you mean by 'strategic necessity' driving your current actions? It's important for us to maintain clear communication to avoid any misunderstandings. How can we better support each other while keeping our borders secure?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905 has been beneficial for both of us. I suggest that you aim for holding Greece and supporting any moves against Turkey if necessary. What are your plans for A VIE and A TYR?
  From ENGLAND: Italy, France has become a major threat with 8 supply centers. Given that you have 6 supply centers, it might be in our mutual interest to form an alliance against France. What are your plans for the next moves and how can we work together to curb France's expansion?
  From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. It seems that you are making good progress in the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean. I suggest that you continue to focus on Austria or Turkey. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful and that we do not make any moves against each other.
  From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I am concerned about your unit in Tyrolia. Can you please clarify your intentions for A TYR? I hope we can continue to focus on our respective goals and avoid any conflicts.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Italy, I hope our non-aggression pact until 1905 still holds. I need to make sure that your unit in GRE does not make any aggressive moves against RUM. Let us make a joint action against Turkey.
  From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I wish to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. Could you please clarify what you meant by 'strategic necessity' in a previous round? I hope we can continue our peaceful relations until the end of 1905 and discuss any potential future collaboration once that period ends.
