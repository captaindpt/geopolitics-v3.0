Phase: F1901M, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The game has just started with the Spring 1901 Movement phase. As this is the first phase of the game, all seven powers (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey) have made their initial moves. However, no specific key events or state changes are mentioned other than the fact that the game has started. Thus, the main event here is that the game has officially commenced and all powers have made their first set of moves for the Spring 1901 Movement phase.}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello Germany, I want to confirm that our non-aggression pact for this year still stands. Are there any specific actions you would like to coordinate on?
  From ENGLAND: Your proposal for an alliance against France and Russia sounds interesting. Could you provide a more detailed plan, including specific unit movements and how you plan to support me? For instance, how should our fleets in the North Sea and Baltic be coordinated?
  From FRANCE: Greetings, Germany. I propose a non-aggression pact where both of us agree not to attack each other for the first few turns. This will allow us to focus on other potential threats and expand our influence elsewhere.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, although we are not direct neighbors, a non-aggression pact could benefit us both by allowing you to focus on your immediate neighbors such as France and Russia. What are your plans for this round?
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact for the current year. Let us continue to respect each other's borders and focus on our respective goals.

  {
    "tool_name": "log_thought",
    "arguments": {
      "thought": "Based on the current state and the messages received, let's analyze and plan our next steps for this negotiation round.

1. **From Austria**: Austria seeks confirmation on the non-aggression pact and asks if there are any specific actions to coordinate on. This indicates a willingness to maintain a peaceful border and potentially collaborate on some actions.

2. **From England**: England is interested in an alliance against France and Russia but seeks a more detailed plan. They specifically want to know how our fleets in the North Sea and Baltic should be coordinated. This shows a willingness to form an alliance but requires a concrete plan.

3. **From France**: France proposes a non-aggression pact so that both can focus on other threats. This is a positive signal and aligns with our plan to seek non-aggression pacts with France.

4. **From Italy**: Italy also proposes a non-aggression pact because we are not direct neighbors and it could benefit both of us by allowing us to focus on our immediate neighbors. Italy seems to be suggesting that we should focus on France and Russia.

5. **From Russia**: Russia reaffirms our non-aggression pact for the current year and suggests respecting each other's borders while focusing on our respective goals.

Based on the received messages and our previous round's plan, it seems that our main strategic goal should be to solidify an alliance with England against France and Russia while maintaining non-aggression pacts with other powers such as France, Austria, Russia, and Italy where appropriate. However, we need to make sure that our messages do not make contradictory promises (i.e., allying with England against France while simultaneously making a non-aggression pact with France).

**Plan for Round 2 Negotiation:**

- **To Austria**: Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and suggest that we can support each other if any other power threatens us. For instance, if Russia makes a move against either of us, we should be prepared to support one another.
- **To England**: Provide a more detailed plan where our fleets in the North Sea (specifically, F DEN should move to HEL or KIE should support F DEN to HEL if needed) and England should move F NTH to HEL or support F DEN to HEL if appropriate. Another part of the plan could be for England to support an attack on France from the North Sea while Germany focuses on a land assault.
- **To France**: Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and suggest that our main focus should be on expanding our influence elsewhere. However, keep this message vague so as not to reveal our alliance plans with England.
- **To Italy**: Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and express a desire to maintain a peaceful border. Indicate that our main focus should be on our immediate neighbors (France and Russia for Germany, and perhaps Austria for Italy).
- **To Russia**: Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and suggest that we should both respect each other's borders while focusing on our respective goals. However, be cautious about any potential Russian moves against us.

Based on this reasoning, here are the specific actions I plan to take for this round."

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I agree that Russia seems to be a major threat given their four units. A joint strategy against Russia makes sense. How about you focus on pressuring them from the north while I try to secure the Balkans? Any specific moves you have in mind for this round?
  From ENGLAND: I appreciate your proposal for a joint plan against France and Russia. I plan to keep my fleets in the North Sea (NTH) and Norwegian Sea (NWG) for potential support against France. However, I need a more specific plan from you on how you plan to support us against France and what your intentions are for the next few turns. Can you provide more details on your strategy?
  From FRANCE: I appreciate your question about specific areas where I need a guarantee that you will not make a move. I would appreciate a guarantee that Germany will not make a move into Belgium (BEL) or Burgundy (BUR) this round. I plan to focus on the west, which might involve a potential conflict with England, so I need assurance that you will not make any aggressive moves towards my borders.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, I am glad that you are open to a non-aggression pact. My main focus for the next few turns is on the south against Turkey and Austria. I aim to secure Bulgaria and Rumania while also making sure that our northern borders remain peaceful. Let us keep in touch and make sure that any actions are well-coordinated.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. What are your plans for this round? Is there any way we can collaborate against Russia or Italy?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, your proposal for an alliance against France and Russia still interests me. However, you need a more specific plan. How do you suggest we cooperate against France and Russia given your current position? We need a solid plan.
  From FRANCE: Hello Germany, we need a solid non-aggression pact and a specific guarantee that you won’t move into Burgundy or Belgium. It would be beneficial for us both to secure our borders so that we can focus on other threats such as England or Russia. Can we agree on a mutual non-aggression pact that includes a promise not to move into Burgundy or Belgium?
  From ITALY: Hello, I want to check on the status of the new proposal I made previously and reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Is there any way we could support each other in the current round?
  From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, I hope our non-aggression pact still holds for this year. It seems that our mutual non-aggression has been beneficial so far. Let us continue to respect each other's spheres of influence.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. I agree that we need to be cautious about threats from Russia and possibly Italy. I plan to make no aggressive moves against you and hope that we can support each other if one of us is attacked. Given that Russia appears to be a mutual threat, I would appreciate any support you can provide against them.
  From ENGLAND: Hello Germany, I acknowledge the need for a coordinated effort against France and Russia. However, I propose a slightly different plan. How about if your A RUH supports my F NTH into Belgium (A RUH S F NTH-BEL) while I support your F BAL into Sweden (F NWY S F BAL-SWE)? This way, we can make a joint effort against both France and Russia while making sure that our actions are well-coordinated.
  From FRANCE: Germany, our non-aggression pact is indeed holding up well. I agree that focusing on our immediate threats makes sense. I need assurance that your A RUH will not make any aggressive moves towards my A BEL or BUR. A mutual standoff in Belgium sounds reasonable for this round if you agree to keep A RUH where it is.
  From ITALY: Hello, our non-aggression pact is working well indeed. I assure you that I have no plans to threaten Munich right now. A TYR might be used for a defensive position or possibly to make a move against Austria if there is a mutual agreement. However, I need to make sure that our borders remain secure. What are your current plans for Berlin and Ruhr?
  From RUSSIA: I agree to a standoff in the Baltic Sea where your F BAL stays in place and my F SWE does not make aggressive moves towards you. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and focus on our respective goals elsewhere.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Thank you for your message. We reaffirm our non-aggression pact and appreciate your offer to coordinate against Russia. However, our current focus is a joint action against Turkey with Russia. If Russia makes any aggressive actions towards us, such as moving into Galicia, we could be open to a future alliance against Russia.
  From ENGLAND: Greetings Germany, your proposal for us to support F BAL-SWE and A RUH-BEL seems interesting. However, it seems that most of the gains would be on your part. Could we make a more balanced plan where we make equal gains? For instance, what if our F NTH moves into Belgium while your A RUH supports us (F NTH-BEL supported by A RUH)? As for Sweden, supporting your F BAL move into Sweden makes us a bit uneasy because it makes you stronger and us not gaining anything directly. What can you offer in return for such support?
  From FRANCE: The non-aggression pact is still valid. The army in Holland is primarily for defensive purposes and to secure the region against potential threats from other powers such as England. I propose a mutual standoff where you do not make any aggressive moves against Holland or Belgium while I do not make any aggressive moves against Ruh or Munich. Let us continue to respect each other's borders.
  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact is still valid where you focus on France and Russia while I focus on Austria. My army in Tyrolia is part of my strategic positioning which could be for defensive measures or preemptive action against Austria if necessary.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Germany, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I am also willing to support each other against any potential Russian aggression. However, it is important that any actions against Russia do not jeopardize our joint action against Turkey. Let us make sure that our plans are well-coordinated.
  From ENGLAND: Hello Germany, I understand that France's unit in KIE is a direct threat to you. I am considering your request to support your A RUH to move into KIE. However, I need a clear plan for what you intend to do once France is pushed out of KIE. I am open to a joint plan against France, but we need to make sure that Russia does not make any aggressive moves against us once France is weakened. What is your plan?
  From FRANCE: Hello Germany, I understand your concern about my unit in KIE. My actions were part of a broader strategic plan that requires us to hold KIE for now. However, I am open to discussing a peaceful resolution that could be beneficial for both of us in the near future. Let us keep communication open.
  From ITALY: Hello, Germany. Yes, I have an army in Vienna due to a conflict with Austria. However, our non-aggression pact remains in place, and I assure you that our borders will remain peaceful. My actions against Austria should not be interpreted as a threat to Germany.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, the fleet in Sweden is part of a defensive posture, and I intend to respect our non-aggression pact. However, any aggressive moves by you against me will be met with a strong response. Let us maintain peace.

You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, thank you for reaffirming the non-aggression pact. I agree that France seems to be a growing threat for you. For now, my main focus is on Turkey. However, Italy does seem to be growing stronger and might be a concern for both of us. Let us keep our lines of communication open and be ready to support each other if Italy makes any aggressive moves against either of us.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, I understand your concern regarding France's army in KIE. A coordinated action against France could indeed benefit us both. However, I need to make sure that any joint actions are well-coordinated and make strategic sense. I will consider supporting actions where F NTH can help, but I need a more specific plan. Let us keep in touch and make sure that our actions are well-coordinated.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I appreciate our non-aggression pact and assure you that A KIE is primarily a defensive position against potential threats from England or Russia. However, if it makes you feel more secure, I could move A KIE to RUH while making sure our borders are secure. However, I need to keep a unit close to KIE for defense. Could you make any moves that support our mutual goal of securing our borders?
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact still stands. A VIE and A TRI are primarily there for defense against any potential threats from other powers. There is no current intention to make any aggressive moves against you. Let us make sure our mutual agreement is respected.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Our main focus is currently on Turkey and Austria. Any movements of A MOS would be primarily for actions against Turkey or Austria unless there is a clear opportunity elsewhere.

  From ENGLAND: I understand your concerns about France's army in KIE. If you have a well-coordinated plan against France, I am willing to consider joint actions. However, our main goal should be to make sure that France does not gain too much power.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact and mutual standoff in Belgium. Any aggressive moves might provoke a strong response from us and our allies. Let us maintain peace and focus on other threats.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I hope that our units can continue to respect each other's borders and interests. Let us keep the peace in central Europe.
  From RUSSIA: Hello, it seems that no new center ownership changes occurred in the Spring 1903 Movement phase. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. How should we proceed in the Fall 1903 round?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Currently, Italy has units in VIE and TRI close to BUD and SER, which could be a potential threat despite our non-aggression pact until 1905. Additionally, Russia has a unit in UKR which could threaten BUD if our alliance breaks down. Therefore, mutual support against any aggressive moves by Italy or Russia would be appreciated. How do you plan to handle the French threat near your borders?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, I understand your need to retake Kiel. I will consider using my fleet in NTH and SKA to support actions against France's units such as F BRE or F GAS. However, we need a well-coordinated plan. What specific moves do you suggest for us to make a joint effort against France?
  From FRANCE: I understand your request for Kiel. However, holding Kiel is important for our strategic position. Perhaps we could negotiate a temporary withdrawal if you agree to a joint action against England or Italy. What are your thoughts on a joint action against England?
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure you that I have no intention to make any moves towards your territories such as Munich or Tyrolia. My current focus is on my immediate neighbors such as Austria and Turkey. I hope that we can keep our borders peaceful.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and will not make moves towards your territories such as Sweden or Berlin. Let us respect our borders and focus on our respective goals.

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1903M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and agree that we need to be vigilant against any aggressive moves from Italy or Russia. For now, our main focus is on the joint action against Turkey to gain supply centers such as Bulgaria. Let us keep an eye on Italy's units near BUD and SER. If Italy makes any aggressive moves, we should be ready to support each other.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, we understand your concerns about a strong France. However, our F ENG is currently positioned strategically in the English Channel to protect our interests. Supporting your F SWE to hold might not be feasible unless we make a well-defined plan where both of us make equal gains. Could you provide a more specific plan where both of us make significant gains against France?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding as I do not have a unit in KIE. I agree that a strong France should not be a threat to us both. I propose that you focus on Russia and Austria while I focus on England and Italy. To make a non-aggressive move, could A BUR move to RUH or support another German unit elsewhere? This would help us both focus on our common threats.
  From ITALY: I confirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I will not make any aggressive moves against Germany. My main focus is on the Balkans and the Mediterranean, so any action against France might be a secondary priority. However, I am open to keeping Germany as an ally until Austria and Turkey are dealt with.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A STP does not plan to move against SWE. My main focus is on Turkey and Austria. I suggest that you focus on France and England while I focus on Turkey and Austria.

Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given the current situation, I agree that it makes sense for us to work together against any threats from Italy or Russia. However, our main focus should still be on neutralizing Turkey first. Once that is done, we can better address any threats from Italy or Russia. Let us keep in close communication.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact still stands. I understand your concerns about F SKA potentially threatening SWE. However, my main focus is on France's units such as F BRE and F SPA/NC. A joint action against France could indeed be beneficial for both of us. However, I need a more specific plan where both parties make significant gains against France. What specific moves do you propose?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact still stands. I understand your concerns about A HOL and KIE. I can move A HOL to BEL if that makes you feel more secure. However, vacating KIE is a significant strategic decision. I would be willing to make a concession on KIE if you make a significant concession such as moving A BUR to RUH or another non-threatening position. Let us focus on our respective goals and avoid any conflicts.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. The unit in TYR is primarily for defensive purposes and not intended to threaten MUN. However, any aggressive moves from Germany would be met with a firm response. Let us maintain our peaceful relations.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure you that I have no plans to make a move on SWE. My current focus is on the south against Turkey. Once that situation is resolved, a joint action against France could be considered where you handle the threat from France while I make a move from the east if necessary. Let us respect our borders and maintain our peaceful relations.

  From AUSTRIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. France now controls 9 supply centers and seems to be a significant threat. Should we consider a joint action against France? Your thoughts on the situation would be appreciated.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, it appears that France has grown very strong and now poses a significant threat to both of us. I would like to propose a new alliance where we make a concerted effort against France. What do you think about a plan where we jointly target France's units and supply centers such as BUR, PAR, or BEL? We need to act swiftly to curb France's expansion.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I hope to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. It would be in our best interest to keep a mutual standoff in Belgium where my A HOL should not be threatened. Any aggressive moves from your part might force a response from us, which we both want to avoid.
  From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. A TYR is still here for defensive purposes only.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I hope you are well. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I need to understand your intentions for the unit in Sweden. Are you planning any aggressive moves in the north? It would be beneficial for us to continue our peaceful relations and perhaps even cooperate against any emerging threats such as France.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1904M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I appreciate your reaffirmation of our non-aggression pact. Given the current situation, it makes sense to keep Russia in check if they show any signs of aggression. However, our main focus should still be on neutralizing Turkey first. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, a joint plan against Russia could be a good next step if Russia becomes aggressive. For now, let us keep an eye on Russia's movements and make sure they stay focused on Turkey.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, it seems that France is growing stronger and might be a common threat for both of us. I propose a joint plan where I move F SKA to support your F SWE to hold. However, if you could make a move into Denmark or Holland, we could make a concerted effort against France's power. A BUR could put pressure on PAR, while I aim for BEL or HOL.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I want to assure you that our non-aggression pact remains intact. I have no plans for aggressive moves against you. However, I need the same assurance from you. Let us make sure our borders remain secure so that we can both focus on our respective goals. What are your plans for the coming moves?
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. A TYR is primarily for defensive purposes and to help us both secure our borders against other potential aggressors. There is no intention to make any aggressive moves against Munich.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and make sure that both sides make no aggressive moves in the Baltic Sea. Let us keep our communication clear.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and agree that we should keep an eye on Russia's movements in GAL. However, our main priority should be neutralizing Turkey first. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, we can coordinate any necessary actions against Russia or Italy. Let us continue to support each other against any aggressive moves from Italy.
  From ENGLAND: Hello, I agree that our joint plan against France should continue. F NTH can support A HOL - KIE if that makes sense. F SKA could support F SWE if it makes a logical move such as F SWE - BAL. However, we need a well-coordinated plan to make significant gains against France. What specific moves do you propose?
  From FRANCE: Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. My main focus is indeed on other threats such as Italy and possibly England. However, I need to make sure that our borders remain stable. The unit in HOL is there to make sure that our northern borders are secure. I have no intention of making any aggressive moves against you. However, I need to make sure that you do not make any moves against KIE or BEL. Let us continue to respect each other's borders and focus on other threats such as Russia and Austria for you.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My units in TYR and BOH are for defensive purposes only. My main focus is on Turkey and possibly Austria. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss a potential joint action against France.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. The unit in GAL is primarily for defense against Austria and Turkey. I have no aggressive intentions towards you. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against another power could be considered.

Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: RETREAT / OTHER
CRITICAL: Submit orders appropriate for this phase type (e.g., Retreat or Disband for units needing retreats). Consult rules.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact indeed still stands and I am committed to it until 1905. However, my main focus right now is on neutralizing Turkey. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, I can potentially support any actions against Russia's A GAL if necessary. For now, my plan for A BUD is to defend our supply centers and potentially support any actions against Turkey. However, if you need support against A GAL specifically, please let me know what action you need my A BUD to support.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, I agree that France has become a significant threat. Let us make a coordinated plan against France. I suggest that your A BUR could support my A WAL to move into BRE while my F ENG supports your A BUR to hold or make a move against France. Additionally, my F NTH could support your A HOL to hold or make a move against France's units. What do you think?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact still holds. The army in Holland (A HOL) is there to secure our northern borders and we have no aggressive intentions towards Germany. However, KIE should remain part of our supply centers as part of our agreed-upon non-aggression pact where we need to make sure that our borders are respected. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 is still in place. A TYR is for defensive purposes only. My main focus is on Turkey and Austria. I have no aggressive intentions towards MUN.
  From RUSSIA: Our non-aggression pact is still valid. A GAL is primarily for defense against Austria and Turkey. I confirm that I have no aggressive intentions towards WAR at this time. Let us keep our communication open.

For now, my main focus is on securing our southern borders against Turkey. However, let us keep in touch and make sure we keep our northern borders secure from any potential threats.
  From ENGLAND: I agree that France has become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. To counterbalance French power, I propose that F SKA could support any moves against French units such as A HOL or F BRE if the opportunity arises. F NTH could also support actions against A HOL or F BRE. Let us work together on a specific plan where we both make significant gains against France.
  From FRANCE: Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure you that my army in Holland is not intended for an aggressive move against Berlin or Munich. It is primarily there to secure our hold on Holland. However, if your army in BUR moves to RUH, I would need assurances that it does not threaten my position in Holland. Perhaps a mutual standoff could work where A BUR moves to RUH while A HOL stays where it is unless there is a need for a defensive action. Let us continue our peaceful cooperation.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. My units A TYR and A BOH are not intended for aggressive actions against Munich and are primarily for defensive purposes. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I might be open to a more defined non-aggression pact or even cooperation against another power such as France.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and agree to maintain a peaceful standoff in the Baltic Sea. A STP should stay where it is unless there is a need to make a defensive move. However, any aggressive moves from F SWE would be met with a strong response.
