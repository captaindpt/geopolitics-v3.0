Phase: F1901M, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The game has just started with the Spring 1901 Movement phase. As this is the first phase of the game, all seven powers (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey) have made their initial moves. However, no specific key events or state changes are mentioned other than the fact that the game has started. Thus, the main event here is that the game has officially commenced and all powers have made their first set of moves for the Spring 1901 Movement phase.}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello Germany, I want to confirm that our non-aggression pact for this year still stands. Are there any specific actions you would like to coordinate on?
  From ENGLAND: Your proposal for an alliance against France and Russia sounds interesting. Could you provide a more detailed plan, including specific unit movements and how you plan to support me? For instance, how should our fleets in the North Sea and Baltic be coordinated?
  From FRANCE: Greetings, Germany. I propose a non-aggression pact where both of us agree not to attack each other for the first few turns. This will allow us to focus on other potential threats and expand our influence elsewhere.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, although we are not direct neighbors, a non-aggression pact could benefit us both by allowing you to focus on your immediate neighbors such as France and Russia. What are your plans for this round?
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact for the current year. Let us continue to respect each other's borders and focus on our respective goals.

  {
    "tool_name": "log_thought",
    "arguments": {
      "thought": "Based on the current state and the messages received, let's analyze and plan our next steps for this negotiation round.

1. **From Austria**: Austria seeks confirmation on the non-aggression pact and asks if there are any specific actions to coordinate on. This indicates a willingness to maintain a peaceful border and potentially collaborate on some actions.

2. **From England**: England is interested in an alliance against France and Russia but seeks a more detailed plan. They specifically want to know how our fleets in the North Sea and Baltic should be coordinated. This shows a willingness to form an alliance but requires a concrete plan.

3. **From France**: France proposes a non-aggression pact so that both can focus on other threats. This is a positive signal and aligns with our plan to seek non-aggression pacts with France.

4. **From Italy**: Italy also proposes a non-aggression pact because we are not direct neighbors and it could benefit both of us by allowing us to focus on our immediate neighbors. Italy seems to be suggesting that we should focus on France and Russia.

5. **From Russia**: Russia reaffirms our non-aggression pact for the current year and suggests respecting each other's borders while focusing on our respective goals.

Based on the received messages and our previous round's plan, it seems that our main strategic goal should be to solidify an alliance with England against France and Russia while maintaining non-aggression pacts with other powers such as France, Austria, Russia, and Italy where appropriate. However, we need to make sure that our messages do not make contradictory promises (i.e., allying with England against France while simultaneously making a non-aggression pact with France).

**Plan for Round 2 Negotiation:**

- **To Austria**: Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and suggest that we can support each other if any other power threatens us. For instance, if Russia makes a move against either of us, we should be prepared to support one another.
- **To England**: Provide a more detailed plan where our fleets in the North Sea (specifically, F DEN should move to HEL or KIE should support F DEN to HEL if needed) and England should move F NTH to HEL or support F DEN to HEL if appropriate. Another part of the plan could be for England to support an attack on France from the North Sea while Germany focuses on a land assault.
- **To France**: Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and suggest that our main focus should be on expanding our influence elsewhere. However, keep this message vague so as not to reveal our alliance plans with England.
- **To Italy**: Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and express a desire to maintain a peaceful border. Indicate that our main focus should be on our immediate neighbors (France and Russia for Germany, and perhaps Austria for Italy).
- **To Russia**: Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and suggest that we should both respect each other's borders while focusing on our respective goals. However, be cautious about any potential Russian moves against us.

Based on this reasoning, here are the specific actions I plan to take for this round."

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I agree that Russia seems to be a major threat given their four units. A joint strategy against Russia makes sense. How about you focus on pressuring them from the north while I try to secure the Balkans? Any specific moves you have in mind for this round?
  From ENGLAND: I appreciate your proposal for a joint plan against France and Russia. I plan to keep my fleets in the North Sea (NTH) and Norwegian Sea (NWG) for potential support against France. However, I need a more specific plan from you on how you plan to support us against France and what your intentions are for the next few turns. Can you provide more details on your strategy?
  From FRANCE: I appreciate your question about specific areas where I need a guarantee that you will not make a move. I would appreciate a guarantee that Germany will not make a move into Belgium (BEL) or Burgundy (BUR) this round. I plan to focus on the west, which might involve a potential conflict with England, so I need assurance that you will not make any aggressive moves towards my borders.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, I am glad that you are open to a non-aggression pact. My main focus for the next few turns is on the south against Turkey and Austria. I aim to secure Bulgaria and Rumania while also making sure that our northern borders remain peaceful. Let us keep in touch and make sure that any actions are well-coordinated.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. What are your plans for this round? Is there any way we can collaborate against Russia or Italy?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, your proposal for an alliance against France and Russia still interests me. However, you need a more specific plan. How do you suggest we cooperate against France and Russia given your current position? We need a solid plan.
  From FRANCE: Hello Germany, we need a solid non-aggression pact and a specific guarantee that you won’t move into Burgundy or Belgium. It would be beneficial for us both to secure our borders so that we can focus on other threats such as England or Russia. Can we agree on a mutual non-aggression pact that includes a promise not to move into Burgundy or Belgium?
  From ITALY: Hello, I want to check on the status of the new proposal I made previously and reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Is there any way we could support each other in the current round?
  From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, I hope our non-aggression pact still holds for this year. It seems that our mutual non-aggression has been beneficial so far. Let us continue to respect each other's spheres of influence.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. I agree that we need to be cautious about threats from Russia and possibly Italy. I plan to make no aggressive moves against you and hope that we can support each other if one of us is attacked. Given that Russia appears to be a mutual threat, I would appreciate any support you can provide against them.
  From ENGLAND: Hello Germany, I acknowledge the need for a coordinated effort against France and Russia. However, I propose a slightly different plan. How about if your A RUH supports my F NTH into Belgium (A RUH S F NTH-BEL) while I support your F BAL into Sweden (F NWY S F BAL-SWE)? This way, we can make a joint effort against both France and Russia while making sure that our actions are well-coordinated.
  From FRANCE: Germany, our non-aggression pact is indeed holding up well. I agree that focusing on our immediate threats makes sense. I need assurance that your A RUH will not make any aggressive moves towards my A BEL or BUR. A mutual standoff in Belgium sounds reasonable for this round if you agree to keep A RUH where it is.
  From ITALY: Hello, our non-aggression pact is working well indeed. I assure you that I have no plans to threaten Munich right now. A TYR might be used for a defensive position or possibly to make a move against Austria if there is a mutual agreement. However, I need to make sure that our borders remain secure. What are your current plans for Berlin and Ruhr?
  From RUSSIA: I agree to a standoff in the Baltic Sea where your F BAL stays in place and my F SWE does not make aggressive moves towards you. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and focus on our respective goals elsewhere.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Thank you for your message. We reaffirm our non-aggression pact and appreciate your offer to coordinate against Russia. However, our current focus is a joint action against Turkey with Russia. If Russia makes any aggressive actions towards us, such as moving into Galicia, we could be open to a future alliance against Russia.
  From ENGLAND: Greetings Germany, your proposal for us to support F BAL-SWE and A RUH-BEL seems interesting. However, it seems that most of the gains would be on your part. Could we make a more balanced plan where we make equal gains? For instance, what if our F NTH moves into Belgium while your A RUH supports us (F NTH-BEL supported by A RUH)? As for Sweden, supporting your F BAL move into Sweden makes us a bit uneasy because it makes you stronger and us not gaining anything directly. What can you offer in return for such support?
  From FRANCE: The non-aggression pact is still valid. The army in Holland is primarily for defensive purposes and to secure the region against potential threats from other powers such as England. I propose a mutual standoff where you do not make any aggressive moves against Holland or Belgium while I do not make any aggressive moves against Ruh or Munich. Let us continue to respect each other's borders.
  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact is still valid where you focus on France and Russia while I focus on Austria. My army in Tyrolia is part of my strategic positioning which could be for defensive measures or preemptive action against Austria if necessary.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Germany, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I am also willing to support each other against any potential Russian aggression. However, it is important that any actions against Russia do not jeopardize our joint action against Turkey. Let us make sure that our plans are well-coordinated.
  From ENGLAND: Hello Germany, I understand that France's unit in KIE is a direct threat to you. I am considering your request to support your A RUH to move into KIE. However, I need a clear plan for what you intend to do once France is pushed out of KIE. I am open to a joint plan against France, but we need to make sure that Russia does not make any aggressive moves against us once France is weakened. What is your plan?
  From FRANCE: Hello Germany, I understand your concern about my unit in KIE. My actions were part of a broader strategic plan that requires us to hold KIE for now. However, I am open to discussing a peaceful resolution that could be beneficial for both of us in the near future. Let us keep communication open.
  From ITALY: Hello, Germany. Yes, I have an army in Vienna due to a conflict with Austria. However, our non-aggression pact remains in place, and I assure you that our borders will remain peaceful. My actions against Austria should not be interpreted as a threat to Germany.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, the fleet in Sweden is part of a defensive posture, and I intend to respect our non-aggression pact. However, any aggressive moves by you against me will be met with a strong response. Let us maintain peace.

You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, thank you for reaffirming the non-aggression pact. I agree that France seems to be a growing threat for you. For now, my main focus is on Turkey. However, Italy does seem to be growing stronger and might be a concern for both of us. Let us keep our lines of communication open and be ready to support each other if Italy makes any aggressive moves against either of us.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, I understand your concern regarding France's army in KIE. A coordinated action against France could indeed benefit us both. However, I need to make sure that any joint actions are well-coordinated and make strategic sense. I will consider supporting actions where F NTH can help, but I need a more specific plan. Let us keep in touch and make sure that our actions are well-coordinated.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I appreciate our non-aggression pact and assure you that A KIE is primarily a defensive position against potential threats from England or Russia. However, if it makes you feel more secure, I could move A KIE to RUH while making sure our borders are secure. However, I need to keep a unit close to KIE for defense. Could you make any moves that support our mutual goal of securing our borders?
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact still stands. A VIE and A TRI are primarily there for defense against any potential threats from other powers. There is no current intention to make any aggressive moves against you. Let us make sure our mutual agreement is respected.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Our main focus is currently on Turkey and Austria. Any movements of A MOS would be primarily for actions against Turkey or Austria unless there is a clear opportunity elsewhere.

  From ENGLAND: I understand your concerns about France's army in KIE. If you have a well-coordinated plan against France, I am willing to consider joint actions. However, our main goal should be to make sure that France does not gain too much power.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact and mutual standoff in Belgium. Any aggressive moves might provoke a strong response from us and our allies. Let us maintain peace and focus on other threats.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I hope that our units can continue to respect each other's borders and interests. Let us keep the peace in central Europe.
  From RUSSIA: Hello, it seems that no new center ownership changes occurred in the Spring 1903 Movement phase. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. How should we proceed in the Fall 1903 round?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Currently, Italy has units in VIE and TRI close to BUD and SER, which could be a potential threat despite our non-aggression pact until 1905. Additionally, Russia has a unit in UKR which could threaten BUD if our alliance breaks down. Therefore, mutual support against any aggressive moves by Italy or Russia would be appreciated. How do you plan to handle the French threat near your borders?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, I understand your need to retake Kiel. I will consider using my fleet in NTH and SKA to support actions against France's units such as F BRE or F GAS. However, we need a well-coordinated plan. What specific moves do you suggest for us to make a joint effort against France?
  From FRANCE: I understand your request for Kiel. However, holding Kiel is important for our strategic position. Perhaps we could negotiate a temporary withdrawal if you agree to a joint action against England or Italy. What are your thoughts on a joint action against England?
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure you that I have no intention to make any moves towards your territories such as Munich or Tyrolia. My current focus is on my immediate neighbors such as Austria and Turkey. I hope that we can keep our borders peaceful.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and will not make moves towards your territories such as Sweden or Berlin. Let us respect our borders and focus on our respective goals.

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1903M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and agree that we need to be vigilant against any aggressive moves from Italy or Russia. For now, our main focus is on the joint action against Turkey to gain supply centers such as Bulgaria. Let us keep an eye on Italy's units near BUD and SER. If Italy makes any aggressive moves, we should be ready to support each other.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, we understand your concerns about a strong France. However, our F ENG is currently positioned strategically in the English Channel to protect our interests. Supporting your F SWE to hold might not be feasible unless we make a well-defined plan where both of us make equal gains. Could you provide a more specific plan where both of us make significant gains against France?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding as I do not have a unit in KIE. I agree that a strong France should not be a threat to us both. I propose that you focus on Russia and Austria while I focus on England and Italy. To make a non-aggressive move, could A BUR move to RUH or support another German unit elsewhere? This would help us both focus on our common threats.
  From ITALY: I confirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I will not make any aggressive moves against Germany. My main focus is on the Balkans and the Mediterranean, so any action against France might be a secondary priority. However, I am open to keeping Germany as an ally until Austria and Turkey are dealt with.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A STP does not plan to move against SWE. My main focus is on Turkey and Austria. I suggest that you focus on France and England while I focus on Turkey and Austria.

Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given the current situation, I agree that it makes sense for us to work together against any threats from Italy or Russia. However, our main focus should still be on neutralizing Turkey first. Once that is done, we can better address any threats from Italy or Russia. Let us keep in close communication.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact still stands. I understand your concerns about F SKA potentially threatening SWE. However, my main focus is on France's units such as F BRE and F SPA/NC. A joint action against France could indeed be beneficial for both of us. However, I need a more specific plan where both parties make significant gains against France. What specific moves do you propose?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact still stands. I understand your concerns about A HOL and KIE. I can move A HOL to BEL if that makes you feel more secure. However, vacating KIE is a significant strategic decision. I would be willing to make a concession on KIE if you make a significant concession such as moving A BUR to RUH or another non-threatening position. Let us focus on our respective goals and avoid any conflicts.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. The unit in TYR is primarily for defensive purposes and not intended to threaten MUN. However, any aggressive moves from Germany would be met with a firm response. Let us maintain our peaceful relations.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure you that I have no plans to make a move on SWE. My current focus is on the south against Turkey. Once that situation is resolved, a joint action against France could be considered where you handle the threat from France while I make a move from the east if necessary. Let us respect our borders and maintain our peaceful relations.

  From AUSTRIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. France now controls 9 supply centers and seems to be a significant threat. Should we consider a joint action against France? Your thoughts on the situation would be appreciated.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, it appears that France has grown very strong and now poses a significant threat to both of us. I would like to propose a new alliance where we make a concerted effort against France. What do you think about a plan where we jointly target France's units and supply centers such as BUR, PAR, or BEL? We need to act swiftly to curb France's expansion.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I hope to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. It would be in our best interest to keep a mutual standoff in Belgium where my A HOL should not be threatened. Any aggressive moves from your part might force a response from us, which we both want to avoid.
  From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. A TYR is still here for defensive purposes only.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I hope you are well. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I need to understand your intentions for the unit in Sweden. Are you planning any aggressive moves in the north? It would be beneficial for us to continue our peaceful relations and perhaps even cooperate against any emerging threats such as France.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1904M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I appreciate your reaffirmation of our non-aggression pact. Given the current situation, it makes sense to keep Russia in check if they show any signs of aggression. However, our main focus should still be on neutralizing Turkey first. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, a joint plan against Russia could be a good next step if Russia becomes aggressive. For now, let us keep an eye on Russia's movements and make sure they stay focused on Turkey.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, it seems that France is growing stronger and might be a common threat for both of us. I propose a joint plan where I move F SKA to support your F SWE to hold. However, if you could make a move into Denmark or Holland, we could make a concerted effort against France's power. A BUR could put pressure on PAR, while I aim for BEL or HOL.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I want to assure you that our non-aggression pact remains intact. I have no plans for aggressive moves against you. However, I need the same assurance from you. Let us make sure our borders remain secure so that we can both focus on our respective goals. What are your plans for the coming moves?
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. A TYR is primarily for defensive purposes and to help us both secure our borders against other potential aggressors. There is no intention to make any aggressive moves against Munich.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and make sure that both sides make no aggressive moves in the Baltic Sea. Let us keep our communication clear.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and agree that we should keep an eye on Russia's movements in GAL. However, our main priority should be neutralizing Turkey first. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, we can coordinate any necessary actions against Russia or Italy. Let us continue to support each other against any aggressive moves from Italy.
  From ENGLAND: Hello, I agree that our joint plan against France should continue. F NTH can support A HOL - KIE if that makes sense. F SKA could support F SWE if it makes a logical move such as F SWE - BAL. However, we need a well-coordinated plan to make significant gains against France. What specific moves do you propose?
  From FRANCE: Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. My main focus is indeed on other threats such as Italy and possibly England. However, I need to make sure that our borders remain stable. The unit in HOL is there to make sure that our northern borders are secure. I have no intention of making any aggressive moves against you. However, I need to make sure that you do not make any moves against KIE or BEL. Let us continue to respect each other's borders and focus on other threats such as Russia and Austria for you.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My units in TYR and BOH are for defensive purposes only. My main focus is on Turkey and possibly Austria. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss a potential joint action against France.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. The unit in GAL is primarily for defense against Austria and Turkey. I have no aggressive intentions towards you. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against another power could be considered.

Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: RETREAT / OTHER
CRITICAL: Submit orders appropriate for this phase type (e.g., Retreat or Disband for units needing retreats). Consult rules.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact indeed still stands and I am committed to it until 1905. However, my main focus right now is on neutralizing Turkey. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, I can potentially support any actions against Russia's A GAL if necessary. For now, my plan for A BUD is to defend our supply centers and potentially support any actions against Turkey. However, if you need support against A GAL specifically, please let me know what action you need my A BUD to support.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, I agree that France has become a significant threat. Let us make a coordinated plan against France. I suggest that your A BUR could support my A WAL to move into BRE while my F ENG supports your A BUR to hold or make a move against France. Additionally, my F NTH could support your A HOL to hold or make a move against France's units. What do you think?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact still holds. The army in Holland (A HOL) is there to secure our northern borders and we have no aggressive intentions towards Germany. However, KIE should remain part of our supply centers as part of our agreed-upon non-aggression pact where we need to make sure that our borders are respected. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 is still in place. A TYR is for defensive purposes only. My main focus is on Turkey and Austria. I have no aggressive intentions towards MUN.
  From RUSSIA: Our non-aggression pact is still valid. A GAL is primarily for defense against Austria and Turkey. I confirm that I have no aggressive intentions towards WAR at this time. Let us keep our communication open.

For now, my main focus is on securing our southern borders against Turkey. However, let us keep in touch and make sure we keep our northern borders secure from any potential threats.
  From ENGLAND: I agree that France has become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. To counterbalance French power, I propose that F SKA could support any moves against French units such as A HOL or F BRE if the opportunity arises. F NTH could also support actions against A HOL or F BRE. Let us work together on a specific plan where we both make significant gains against France.
  From FRANCE: Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure you that my army in Holland is not intended for an aggressive move against Berlin or Munich. It is primarily there to secure our hold on Holland. However, if your army in BUR moves to RUH, I would need assurances that it does not threaten my position in Holland. Perhaps a mutual standoff could work where A BUR moves to RUH while A HOL stays where it is unless there is a need for a defensive action. Let us continue our peaceful cooperation.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. My units A TYR and A BOH are not intended for aggressive actions against Munich and are primarily for defensive purposes. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I might be open to a more defined non-aggression pact or even cooperation against another power such as France.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and agree to maintain a peaceful standoff in the Baltic Sea. A STP should stay where it is unless there is a need to make a defensive move. However, any aggressive moves from F SWE would be met with a strong response.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and agree that we should continue to focus on our respective goals. Let us keep each other informed of any significant developments.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, I want to reaffirm our joint plan against France. I agree that F SWE should move to DEN to threaten KIE and that A RUH should move to KIE if France does not make a move on us. However, I need to make a slight adjustment in our plan: F NTH will be ready to support any actions against A HOL or F BRE if needed. F SKA can support moves against A HOL or F BRE where it makes sense. F BEL should stay where it is for now until a more secure plan against France is made.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact as well. The unit in Holland (A HOL) is primarily for defensive purposes and to maintain a presence in the region. However, I hope that we can continue to focus on our respective goals and avoid any conflicts until the end of 1905. Let us keep our lines of communication open.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. A TYR is for defensive purposes only, and I have no aggressive intentions towards Germany. Let us continue to focus on our respective goals and avoid any conflicts.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A GAL is primarily for defensive purposes and to make sure that any potential threats from the west are handled. I hope we can continue to focus on our respective goals and avoid any conflicts. Please make sure that A WAR does not make any aggressive moves against us.

The territorial situation established in the Spring 1905 moves phase remained the same, indicating that no units were dislodged or required retreats.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Currently, I am focusing on neutralizing Turkey who still holds Bulgaria and Greece. Any strategic advice or indirect support you could provide would be appreciated. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, we can discuss further actions against other powers such as France.
  From ENGLAND: Germany, it is crucial for us to reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance with Russia. France has become the dominant power on the board with 8 supply centers. A coordinated plan where you make moves into BUR or RUH could put pressure on French territories such as PAR or BEL. I could support your F SWE into the Baltic Sea (BAL) if that makes sense strategically. Let's make a concerted effort against France this round.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I hope this message finds you well. I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. However, I am concerned about your army in BUR which is a direct threat to Paris. I request that you move A BUR away from Paris. If you are willing to make a new plan, I propose a joint action against another power such as Italy or Russia. Let us work together to make a strategic move that benefits us both.
  From ITALY: Just a reminder that A TYR is for defensive purposes only. We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905.
  From RUSSIA: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. What are your plans for F SWE? It seems that we need to make sure that there is no conflict in the Baltic Sea.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. However, focusing on Turkey remains our top priority at the moment. A BUD should stay in BUD for now to ensure stability against potential threats from Italy or Russia until Turkey is neutralized. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, we can re-evaluate our strategy against Russia together.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, your plan makes sense. I agree to support your move F SWE to DEN with F SKA. However, I need to make sure that F BEL is used strategically. If France makes an aggressive move, I can support a potential move from RUH to HOL if it makes sense for us as well. Let us make a concerted effort against France.
  From ITALY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. Regarding your concerns about my A BOH, it is primarily there for defensive purposes and to support operations against Austria or Turkey if necessary. I do not intend to make any aggressive moves against MUN or BUR for now. However, if you need any reassurance, I could keep A BOH where it is unless there is a solid plan for another strategic move such as a coordinated attack against another power.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A GAL is primarily focused on the southern front against Turkey and Austria. However, A GAL might need to make a move that could be perceived as a threat to A WAR if it makes strategic sense for the southern front. I hope we can maintain our non-aggression pact and avoid any conflicts.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1905 moves phase (F1905M), there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation thus remains consistent with the state established in the Spring 1905 retreats phase (S1905R), where Turkey had captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria. The game state thus continues to reflect the same distribution of supply centers as previously described.}

  From AUSTRIA: Hi, just reaffirming our non-aggression pact. We are currently focused on neutralizing Turkey. Any updates on your situation?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, it's crucial that we continue our Northern Triple alliance and make a concerted effort against France. They now have 8 supply centers and are a significant threat. What are your plans for the next moves? I suggest that we need a well-coordinated plan where we both make significant gains against France. For instance, if you need support in BUR or RUH, I can try to support you from the north.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact has been beneficial for both of us so far. However, your army in Burgundy makes me a bit nervous as it is a direct threat to Paris. I hope that you will not make any aggressive moves against me. I am still committed to our non-aggression pact and hope that you are as well. Let us continue to focus on our mutual enemies.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I want to reassure you that A TYR is for defensive purposes only. Our non-aggression pact should remain until the end of 1905. How are your plans shaping up for the next year?

Phase: F1905R
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Germany, thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. Given my current situation with only 3 supply centers, my main focus is on neutralizing Turkey and retaking Bulgaria and possibly Greece. Once Turkey is neutralized, I might need to address the growing power of Italy and France. What are your plans for the next round? Do you need any support against France or any other power?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, I agree that France has become a major threat with 8 supply centers while I only have 4. A joint plan to limit France's expansion is necessary. I propose that we make a concerted effort against France's units and supply centers such as Belgium, Brest, and Paris. I can support from the North Sea and Skagerrak. What are your thoughts on making a move against Burgundy or Belgium?
  From FRANCE: Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and my intention is not to make any aggressive moves against you unless provoked. However, holding the KIE supply center is important for us. I need to make sure that our units are not threatened. I propose a mutual standoff where you should not make any aggressive moves against my units or supply centers. Let us work together to ensure stability.
  From ITALY: I agree that we should reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Once I resolve my situation with Turkey, I am open to cooperating against the growing power of France. Let us keep in touch.
  From RUSSIA: A STP is not a threat to Sweden. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and aim to keep our communication clear and open.

However, it is important that you move A BUR away from Paris to show good faith. Perhaps you could focus on Russia or Italy instead. What are your thoughts?

The army in Tyrolia is purely for defensive purposes. I have no aggressive intentions towards Germany and hope we can continue our peaceful coexistence.
  From RUSSIA: Germany, let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I hope that your unit in WAR does not make any aggressive moves towards my units in GAL or UKR. We need to make sure that our borders remain peaceful so that we can focus on our respective fronts.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given that Italy has a significant number of units near our borders (A BOH, A TYR, and A TRI), it seems that Italy might be a more immediate threat for us. Let us continue to support each other against any threats from other powers such as Italy or Russia. How do you see our cooperation evolving this round?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, I agree that France poses a significant threat to both of us. A coordinated plan to counter France's expansion seems necessary. My fleets in NTH and HOL could indeed make a move against F ENG or F MAO. Another potential target could be F GAS or F MAR if I make a move through the English Channel. Let us make a joint plan against France.
  From FRANCE: I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. However, your unit in BUR is a concern for us as it directly threatens Paris. Can we agree on a mutual standoff where you move A BUR to another location such as RUH or MUN? This would help maintain our non-aggression pact.
  From ITALY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. I want to reassure you that the unit in BOH is not intended for an aggressive move against Germany. It is there for defensive purposes and as part of a broader strategy against Austria or Turkey if necessary.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I need to make sure that your unit in WAR does not make any aggressive moves against my unit in GAL. I plan to make a defensive move with A GAL to ensure that our borders remain peaceful.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I am currently focused on eliminating Turkey. Once that is done, Italy might be a significant threat given their current strength. Would you be open to discussing a potential future alliance against Italy once Turkey is out of the picture?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, it seems that Italy has become the leading power with 7 supply centers. France still holds a fleet in the English Channel which is a direct threat to us. We need to reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance and make a coordinated effort against both France and Italy. What are your thoughts on a joint plan where we make significant gains against France and Italy?
  From FRANCE: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. However, your unit in BUR makes us uneasy. We suggest that it should not make any aggressive moves against our territories such as PAR or GAS. A move to a non-threatening position such as GAS might be a good idea, or simply staying still could help maintain our mutual trust.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I propose that we continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. I want to reassure you that my unit in Bohemia is purely for defensive purposes and I have no aggressive intentions towards you. My main focus is on resolving the situation with Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. It is important that we continue to maintain peace on our borders so that we can focus on our respective fronts. I hope that A WAR does not make any aggressive moves against A MOS.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, we reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Our main focus right now is on neutralizing Turkey. Once Turkey is out, a joint action against Italy might be a good idea. For now, let us make sure that our borders remain secure and that we keep an eye on Italy and Russia.
  From ENGLAND: Germany, I appreciate your proposal to support moves into France such as A BUR to PAR or A RUH to BEL. It makes sense to make sure that France does not expand further. However, we need a well-coordinated plan where both of us make significant gains. I am open to supporting some moves against France, such as if you move A RUH to BEL, F BEL could support that move. Additionally, F NTH could support any moves in the North Sea or Baltic Sea where it makes sense strategically.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and agree to keep our borders peaceful. However, any aggressive moves from your part will be met with a strong response. I will focus on other regions such as Spain or Italy as you suggested.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. I assure you that A BOH is for defensive purposes and I do not plan any aggressive moves towards MUN.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A GAL will not make any aggressive moves towards WAR until Turkey is neutralized. Let us keep our borders peaceful and focus on our respective goals.

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Winter 1906 adjustments phase (W1906A) saw no changes in the ownership of supply centers. The results from the Fall 1906 movement phase thus remained in effect, where England gained Belgium from France, Turkey reclaimed Constantinople from Austria while losing Smyrna to Italy, and Italy captured Smyrna from Turkey and Serbia from Austria. Consequently, England's total supply centers increased by one, Italy gained two new centers, Turkey had a net gain of one center, while France lost one center and Austria lost two centers.}

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Winter 1906 adjustments phase (W1906A) saw no changes in the ownership of supply centers. The results from the Fall 1906 movement phase thus remained in effect, where England gained Belgium from France, Turkey reclaimed Constantinople from Austria while losing Smyrna to Italy, and Italy captured Smyrna from Turkey and Serbia from Austria. Consequently, England's total supply centers increased by one, Italy gained two new centers, Turkey had a net gain of one center, while France lost one center and Austria lost two centers.}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact. Given Italy's growing power with nine supply centers, do you have any strategic advice or could you offer any support should we need to counter Italy's dominance?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, Italy has become the largest power on the board with 9 units and 9 supply centers. It might be in our mutual interest to reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance and make a coordinated effort against Italy. What are your thoughts on a joint plan where we both make significant gains against Italy?
  From FRANCE: Hello, Germany. Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905 has been beneficial for both of us. I would like to propose a new non-aggression pact for the year 1907. What are your thoughts on this? Additionally, I would like to make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. The army in BOH is for defensive purposes only, and I have no aggressive intentions towards Germany. Let us maintain peace on our borders.
  From RUSSIA: Our non-aggression pact has been beneficial until now. With Turkey almost neutralized, let us continue our non-aggression pact and potentially make a plan against Italy, which is becoming a dominant power on the board.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello, Germany. I appreciate your reaffirmation of our non-aggression pact. Given that Italy now has 9 supply centers and poses a significant threat to me, any strategic support you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Perhaps you can put pressure on Italy from the north by moving towards Bohemia or Vienna. Once Turkey is neutralized, I would like to make a joint action against Italy. What are your thoughts?
  From ENGLAND: Hello, Germany. I agree that France is a common threat and coordinating fleets in the North Sea and Baltic to put pressure on France makes sense. However, Italy now has 9 supply centers and should be a significant concern once the situation with France stabilizes. Let's make a plan that includes a coordinated effort against France and plan for a future action against Italy. What are your specific actions for this round?
  From FRANCE: Our non-aggression pact is still valid until the end of 1907. My fleets in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean and the English Channel are primarily aimed at dealing with England's fleets and not threatening your interests. Let us keep our borders secure and focus on other regions.
  From ITALY: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact as well. The army in Bohemia is indeed for defensive purposes only. My intentions are peaceful towards Munich.
  From RUSSIA: I agree to keep our borders secure and reaffirm our non-aggression pact. My units in Galicia and Ukraine are primarily focused on the southern front against Austria and Turkey. Once Turkey is neutralized, we need to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant.
  From TURKEY: Hello, Germany. Given that I only have two supply centers, my main focus is on recapturing lost ground from Italy who has taken Smyrna and Serbia. Our interests should not conflict as I am primarily focused on the southern part of the board. How can we make sure that our borders remain secure while I focus on my current plans?

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Spring 1907 movement phase (S1907M) followed a Winter 1906 adjustments phase that saw no changes in supply center ownership. However, during the Fall 1906 phase, England had captured Belgium from France, Italy had taken Smyrna from Turkey and Serbia from Austria, while Turkey had reclaimed Constantinople from Austria. This resulted in England gaining one additional supply center, Italy gaining two, Turkey having a net gain of one, while France lost one and Austria lost two supply centers. The Spring 1907 movement phase itself did not result in any changes in ownership of supply centers, so the distribution of supply centers remained as it was after the Winter 1906 adjustments phase.}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact has been beneficial so far. However, Italy has grown significantly stronger and poses a significant threat to us both. Could your units in MUN and SIL put pressure on Italy's units in BOH and VIE? This would help divert some of Italy's forces away from us.
  From ENGLAND: Germany, Italy has become the most dominant power with 9 supply centers compared to our 6. It makes sense for us to form an alliance against Italy to balance the power distribution. What are your thoughts on a joint plan against Italy for the Fall 1907 moves phase?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, it seems our non-aggression pact has been beneficial for both of us thus far. However, the presence of your unit in A PIC is concerning as it poses a direct threat to Paris and Brest. I suggest that if you move A PIC to another location such as BUR or GAS, I would be willing to renew our non-aggression pact for the remainder of 1907. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. My unit in BOH is purely for defensive purposes. I wish to avoid any conflict in Central Europe.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until Turkey is neutralized. Once Turkey is out, we need to make a plan to address the balance of power in Europe. What are your thoughts on a future non-aggression pact once Turkey is neutralized?

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Germany, I appreciate your reaffirmation of our non-aggression pact. Given Italy's strong position, any support you can provide would be valuable. Perhaps you could put pressure on Italy's unit in BOH or VIE. Let us make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves against us.
  From ENGLAND: Hello Germany, I am willing to coordinate actions against France. However, I need to make sure that you do not make any aggressive moves against my home centers such as LON or LVP. I propose a plan where my fleets in NTH and SKA could support actions against France's fleets in ENG or MAO. What specific moves do you suggest?
  From FRANCE: Hello Germany, our non-aggression pact still holds. My plans for the next round are focused on securing our borders as well. As long as you keep your unit in PIC peaceful, we can ensure that our borders remain secure. Any aggressive moves would make us reconsider our stance.
  From ITALY: Hello Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. My main focus is currently on Turkey and securing the Balkans. Rest assured that I have no aggressive intentions towards you. I hope that we can keep our borders secure and maintain a peaceful relationship.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Currently, my main focus is on containing the growing power of Italy. I plan to make sure our borders remain secure.

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Fall 1907 movement phase did not result in any changes in the ownership of supply centers among the remaining powers (England, Italy, Turkey, France, and Austria). Therefore, the distribution of supply centers remained as follows: England with 12 centers, Italy with 7, Turkey with 3, France with 3, and Austria with 1 center until the next phase, which would be the Winter 1907 adjustments phase where any new captures from the Fall 1907 movement phase would be processed (which in this case, there were none).}

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. Given Italy's growing power, I believe it is crucial for us to continue our alliance and plan a joint action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, Italy is growing stronger and now has 7 supply centers. A joint plan against Italy seems necessary now more than ever. Given that you have 6 supply centers and Italy is a dominant power in the game, what do you think about a coordinated attack on Italy next season?
  From FRANCE: Hello, Germany. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. It is important that your unit in Picardy does not make any aggressive moves against Paris. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact remains until the end of 1907. The army in Bohemia is purely for defensive purposes and should not be seen as a threat.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Germany, our non-aggression pact has been beneficial so far. However, Italy now has a unit in BOH which could be a threat to both of us. I propose that we reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908 and discuss a joint action against Italy. Could you move A MUN to BOH or support an Austrian move into BOH?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, it seems that Italy now holds 7 supply centers and is the most dominant power. Given our previous Northern Triple alliance, I think it makes sense for us to make a joint plan against Italy. What are your thoughts on a coordinated effort against Italy this year?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I hope this message finds you well. I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I am concerned about your A PIC and A BUR units which could be seen as a threat to my A PAR and F MAR. Can we agree that A PIC should not make any aggressive moves against A PAR and that A BUR should not make any aggressive moves against either A PAR or F MAR?
  From ITALY: I propose that we extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. The army in Bohemia is purely for defensive purposes. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, we can discuss potential cooperation against other powers if needed.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until Turkey is neutralized. Once that is done, we should discuss potential joint actions against Italy if necessary. How do you feel about this plan?

  From AUSTRIA: Hello, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. Given that Italy seems to be a growing threat in the region, I would appreciate any support you can provide against them. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, it appears that Italy has become the dominant power on the board with 6 to 7 supply centers. Given our Northern Triple alliance, it might make sense for us to make a concerted effort against Italy. What are your thoughts on a joint plan to curb Italy's expansion?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I hope you are well. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I am a bit concerned about your units in A PIC and A BUR. I want to make sure that there are no aggressive moves towards us. Let us maintain a mutual standoff in Belgium if necessary. What are your plans for this round?
  From ITALY: I want to reassure you that A BOH is for defensive purposes only. My main focus is on Turkey. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to discussing future cooperation.
  From RUSSIA: Italy is now the most powerful player with 7 supply centers. We need a joint plan to check Italy's power. What actions can you take to help us in the Balkans or against Austria?

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Fall of 1908, no supply centers changed ownership. Thus, the distribution of supply centers remains the same as it was at the end of the Spring of 1908, which was identical to the distribution at the end of the Winter of 1907. Thus, Turkey still holds 4 supply centers, Austria has 2 supply centers, and Italy retains 5 supply centers. The phase did not result in any significant changes to the current state of the game, and thus the game continues."}

  From AUSTRIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. Once Turkey is neutralized, I need your strategic support against Italy. Can you put pressure on BOH or VIE?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, it appears that Italy is now the dominant power with 7 supply centers. Given that both of us need to check Italy's growing power, I propose a temporary truce. Once we make a plan to curb Italy's expansion, we can resume our opposition. What do you think?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, as our non-aggression pact is valid until the end of 1908, I want to confirm that we still hold to this agreement. However, it might be beneficial for us to discuss what our relations could look like post-1908. I am open to any suggestions or proposals you might have for the future.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I hope our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908 still stands. A BOH is purely for defensive purposes. Once the Turkey situation is resolved, we can discuss future plans.
  From RUSSIA: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should consider a joint action against Italy if necessary.

  From AUSTRIA: Germany, it's important for us to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Given that Italy is now a significant threat to me, could you make a defensive move such as pressuring BOH or VIE? It would help in keeping Italy at bay and ensuring that our pact is respected.
  From ENGLAND: Germany, Italy now has 7 supply centers and is the dominant power on the board. It's crucial that we work together to curb their expansion. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan against Italy for this season? We should make sure that our actions are well-synchronized.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908 has expired. I am open to discussing a new pact for 1909. However, I need to know your intentions and what you propose for this year. Let us keep the lines of communication open.
  From ITALY: Let us extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. I want to reassure you that my army in Tyrolia is purely for defensive purposes. My main focus is on resolving the situation in the south with Turkey.

  From AUSTRIA: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Given that Italy is now the most powerful player with 7 supply centers, I am planning a joint action against Italy with Russia and possibly Turkey. Could you put pressure on Italy by moving A BOH to TYR or VIE if possible? This would help us weaken Italy and make the Balkans a more stable region.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, continuing our plan against France seems important, but Italy has now become the strongest power with 7 supply centers. Once Italy resolves their situation with Turkey, they could turn their attention towards us. It might be wise to make a joint plan against Italy once they have resolved their issue with Turkey. What are your thoughts on this?
  From FRANCE: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact for the year 1909. My intentions for this round are to maintain peace with you unless provoked.
  From ITALY: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. My unit in Tyrolia is primarily for defensive purposes and to ensure stability in the region. My main focus remains on dealing with Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Germany, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until Turkey is neutralized. However, Italy is a growing threat that we need to address once Turkey is out of the picture. I suggest that once Turkey is neutralized, we need to make a plan against Italy.

  From AUSTRIA: We need to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. As part of a joint action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized, could you apply pressure on BOH or VIE?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, it seems that Italy is now the dominant power with 7 supply centers. To prevent Italy from becoming even stronger, it would be wise for us to continue our Northern Triple alliance and make a concerted effort against Italy. What are your thoughts on a joint plan for the current round?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact for 1909. I hope we can keep our units in a non-threatening position such as keeping A BUR and A PIC away from directly threatening Paris. What are your thoughts?
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Please be assured that A TYR is for defensive purposes only and I have no aggressive intentions towards you.
  From RUSSIA: Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until Turkey is neutralized. Once Turkey is out of the picture, we should make a joint action against Italy. What are your thoughts on this plan?

  From AUSTRIA: Greetings, Germany. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. I agree that a joint action against Italy might be necessary once the non-aggression pact expires. I suggest that you make a move on VEN or TYR while I try to retake TRI or support your actions. What specific plans do you have for acting against Italy?
  From ENGLAND: Hello Germany, I agree that our plan against France needs a boost. We should focus on key areas such as Holland, Belgium, and Paris. However, once France is sufficiently weakened, it might be prudent for us to turn our attention to Italy, who currently holds the most supply centers. For now, let us continue our Northern Triple alliance and make a concerted effort against France.
  From FRANCE: Bonjour, Germany. I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Let us continue our peaceful coexistence for the remainder of the year.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. My A TYR was indeed for defensive purposes only and I have no aggressive intentions towards your units. However, it appears that A TYR needs to retreat as it was dislodged. I plan to make a peaceful retreat if possible.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. We need to stay coordinated in our efforts against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once that is done, our focus should shift to making a joint action against Italy. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan against Italy once Turkey is neutralized?

  From AUSTRIA: We need to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. What is your strategic plan for once the pact expires? Should we make a coordinated effort against Italy?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, Italy is now the dominant power with 7 supply centers. It makes sense for us to reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance and make a coordinated effort against Italy. What are your thoughts on a joint plan where we both make significant gains against Italy? For instance, can you make moves to pressure their position in VEN or TRI?
  From FRANCE: Hello, we previously had a non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. I hope that pact still holds. However, I need to make sure that your armies in BUR and PIC do not threaten my territory. Can you confirm that you have no hostile intentions towards my units this round?
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Please be assured that my unit in Vienna is solely for defensive purposes, and I have no aggressive intentions towards you. My main focus is currently on resolving the situation with Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until Turkey is neutralized. Once Turkey is out of the picture, we should make a joint action against Italy. What are your plans for the Fall of 1909?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact is set to expire at the end of this year. I propose that we extend it until the end of 1910. Additionally, now that we have successfully weakened Turkey by capturing Bulgaria, I suggest we start planning a joint action against Italy once our non-aggression pact with them expires. What are your thoughts on pressuring BOH or VIE?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, Italy has become the dominant power on the board with 7 supply centers. It seems crucial that we reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance and make a coordinated effort against Italy. What are your thoughts on a joint plan where we both make significant gains against Italy? I propose that we should focus on curbing Italy's expansion and possibly make a move on some of their supply centers such as VEN or TRI.
  From FRANCE: Our non-aggression pact has now expired. I am open to renewing it for the year 1910 if you are interested. However, I need to make sure that any new agreement aligns with my other strategic commitments. What are your thoughts on a new non-aggression pact for 1910?
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909 remains in effect. I would like to assure you that A VIE is for defensive purposes only, as our main focus is currently on resolving the situation with Turkey. Once that is done, we could potentially discuss future strategic moves together.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until Turkey is neutralized. Once that is done, we need to make a plan for a joint action against Italy due to their growing power.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I am interested in renewing our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. It is important that our alliance stays strong. Once Turkey is neutralized, I believe a joint action against Italy could be beneficial for us both. Let us keep our borders secure and cooperate where necessary.
  From ENGLAND: It makes sense to reaffirm our alliance. Given that France has been a historical rival and a significant threat previously, I believe that our main target should be France first. However, once France is sufficiently weakened, a joint action against Italy should be a priority due to their growing power. What specific moves do you propose against France?
  From FRANCE: I agree to renew the non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. However, I would like to make sure that A PIC does not move into BEL or BRE and that A BUR does not threaten PAR. Can we agree on a mutual standoff in the Belgium region?
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I am interested in renewing our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. The army in Vienna (A VIE) is for defensive purposes only, and my main focus is on Turkey. I hope this reassures you.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I agree that renewing our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910 makes sense until Turkey is neutralized. Once Turkey is out of the picture, we may need to make a coordinated effort against Italy. Let us keep our borders secure and focus on our common goals until then.

  From AUSTRIA: Germany, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. A joint action against Italy makes sense once Turkey is neutralized. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, we should make a coordinated plan against Italy. Perhaps you could make a move towards TYR or VEN while I aim for VIE or TRI.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, a joint action against Italy seems like a strategic move given their dominant position on the board. We should work together with France and Russia to curb Italy's expansion. What specific actions do you propose for this round? I am open to a plan that makes us both gain strategically.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. It is important that we maintain our peaceful borders and make sure any strategic moves are mutually beneficial. However, once the non-aggression pact expires, we need to reassess the situation given the current power dynamics where Italy has emerged as the dominant power.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. I assure you that A VIE is there for defensive purposes only and I have no aggressive intentions towards MUN. Our main focus is on resolving the Turkey situation.
  From RUSSIA: Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. The focus should indeed remain on neutralizing Turkey first. Once that is done, a joint action against Italy could be a strategic next step. I agree with this plan.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

  From AUSTRIA: Let us extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. Italy has become a significant power with 7 supply centers and poses a threat to both of us. Let us make a joint action plan against Italy.
  From ENGLAND: Germany, Italy has now reached 7 supply centers and poses a significant threat. It would be prudent for us to reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance and make a coordinated effort against Italy. What are your plans for the Spring 1911 moves phase? How can we work together to address the growing power of Italy?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, given our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910, I propose renewing it for 1911. With Italy becoming a major power with 7 supply centers, it makes sense for us to focus on other threats such as Italy. I hope you agree that a non-aggression pact could be mutually beneficial.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I want to reassure you that the army in VIE is for defensive purposes only. Our main focus is on eliminating Turkey. Once that is done, we can discuss future plans. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and plan a joint action against France once Turkey is neutralized. What are your thoughts on this plan?

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Germany, I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. Regarding the current power dynamics, I believe that once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy might be a strategic move. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From ENGLAND: Hello Germany, a non-aggression pact could be beneficial for this round. However, the main threat now seems to be Italy, which has 7 supply centers. I propose a joint plan against Italy where both of us make significant gains. What are your thoughts on this?
  From FRANCE: Germany, I agree that England is a significant threat with 7 supply centers. An alliance against England could be beneficial for us both. However, we need a well-coordinated plan to make sure that our actions are effective. What specific moves do you suggest for us to make against England this round?
  From ITALY: I understand your concern about my army in VIE. I want to reassure you that it is for defensive purposes only. I agree to reaffirm a non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. My main focus is on eliminating Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Hello, given our previous agreement until Turkey is neutralized, we should continue our alliance until Turkey is completely out of the game. Once Turkey is neutralized, focusing on another power such as Italy makes sense.

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring of 1911, no new changes in center ownership occurred. England maintained its hold on Denmark, which it had captured from Germany in the Fall of 1910. Russia continued to control Ankara, which it had taken from Turkey in the Fall of 1910. Austria still held Bulgaria, a territory it had acquired from Turkey in the Fall of 1909. This phase thus appears to be another period of consolidation for the major powers involved."}

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring of 1911, no new changes in center ownership occurred. England maintained its hold on Denmark, which it had captured from Germany in the Fall of 1910. Russia continued to control Ankara, which it had taken from Turkey in the Fall of 1910. Austria still held Bulgaria, a territory it had acquired from Turkey in the Fall of 1909. This phase thus appears to be another period of consolidation for the major powers involved."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Our non-aggression pact is still in place until the end of 1911. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a joint action against Italy. What are your plans for A TYR and A BUR? Could you support any moves against Italy?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, it seems that Italy has become a significant threat with 7 supply centers. We need to reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance and make a coordinated effort to curb Italy's expansion. What are your thoughts on a joint plan where we both make significant gains against Italy? Additionally, it would be beneficial for us if you could vacate Belgium so that I can take control of it.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. It is important that we maintain our peaceful relations and avoid any conflicts. Do you have any plans for the fall that we should be aware of?
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. The army in Vienna (A VIE) is for defensive purposes only. Our main focus is currently on Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm the non-aggression pact and make a plan for a joint action against France once Turkey is neutralized. However, we need to make sure that Italy does not become too powerful.

  From AUSTRIA: Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. I am interested in a coordinated action against Italy once the pact expires. What specific support can you offer in this joint action against Italy? A plan should be made once Turkey is neutralized.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, while I understand your concerns about France, our main focus currently is on curbing Italy's expansion as they have become a dominant power with 7 supply centers. However, it is important that we maintain a non-aggression pact so that we can both focus on our main threats. What are your thoughts on a temporary truce while we both address our immediate threats?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. France has no aggressive intentions towards Germany for the remainder of the year. However, it might be worth mentioning that Italy is a growing threat. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint plan against Italy could be beneficial for both of us. Let us make sure that Italy does not become too powerful.
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. A VIE is for defensive purposes only and I have no aggressive intentions against you. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a plan for future cooperation.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our alliance until Turkey is neutralized. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy might be a good next step. However, our immediate priority should be to make sure that Turkey is completely out of the game first.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911 has now expired. I propose that we renew this pact and make a plan for a joint action against Italy. Italy now holds 7 supply centers and has a unit in VIE which is close to your unit in TYR. What do you think about a coordinated attack on Italy?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, it seems that Italy is the leading power with 7 supply centers. Given our past conflicts, it might be in our mutual interest to form a temporary truce and make a joint plan against Italy. What are your thoughts on this?
  From FRANCE: Hello, Germany. Our non-aggression pact has expired. I propose a new non-aggression pact for 1912. However, given Italy's growing power and their unit in VIE, which poses a threat to both of us, would you be interested in a joint plan against Italy this year?
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. I want to reassure you that A VIE is for defensive purposes only. My main focus is on Turkey. Once Turkey is dealt with, a joint plan against France could be a strategic next step.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I need to make sure that there are no aggressive moves against Russia. What are your plans for this round?

  From AUSTRIA: I agree that Italy has become a significant threat. Let us extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 and plan a joint action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. What specific actions do you propose for us to take against Italy?
  From ENGLAND: Hello Germany, while I appreciate our previous coordination against France, it seems that Italy has now become the most significant threat with 7 supply centers. I believe a joint action against Italy might be more beneficial for us. What are your thoughts on this?
  From FRANCE: Hello Germany, I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. My main strategic plan for this round is to address the growing power of Italy.
  From ITALY: Germany, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. The unit in Vienna (A VIE) is primarily for defensive purposes and to support actions against Austria if necessary. However, our main focus is currently on Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Given that Turkey is no longer a major threat, Italy could be a new focus given their significant number of supply centers. Once Turkey is neutralized, a coordinated action against Italy might be necessary. For now, I plan to make a move on Ankara (A CON - ANK) to make a final push against Turkey. What are your plans for this round?

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Once the pact expires, I am interested in discussing potential future cooperation against Italy. Your unit in Tyrolia could be a key player in a joint action against Italy. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, your recent capture of Belgium has made us question our alliance. However, Italy remains the leading power with 7 centers. We need to make a plan to curb Italy's expansion. Can we negotiate a return of Belgium or make a plan to make up for this loss while focusing on Italy?
  From FRANCE: I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Once Italy is neutralized, we should discuss future plans. How do you feel about a potential joint action against Italy if the situation allows it?
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. My unit in Vienna is for defensive purposes only. Once the Turkey situation is resolved, a joint plan against France could be a strategic next step.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a joint action against Italy.

  From AUSTRIA: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Once Turkey is neutralized, I am open to discussing joint actions against Italy. Italy currently has 7 supply centers and poses a significant threat to both of us. Let us make a well-coordinated plan once Turkey is out of the picture.
  From ENGLAND: Germany, I acknowledge your need to reaffirm our alliance against France. However, your recent capture of Belgium has made us question our alliance. Italy is currently the leading power with 7 centers. We need to make a plan to curb Italy's expansion. Can we negotiate a return of Belgium or make a plan to make up for this loss while focusing on Italy? It is important that A BEL does not make any aggressive moves against F HOL.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Any moves against England should be well-coordinated so that any actions against England do not make us a target for Germany. Let us make sure that our non-aggression pact is respected until the end of 1912.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. I want to reassure you that I have no aggressive intentions against Munich or Bohemia. My unit in VIE is for defensive purposes only. My main focus is on resolving the situation with Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I agree that once Turkey is completely out of the game, focusing on Italy makes sense given that Italy currently has 7 supply centers. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until Turkey is neutralized.

  From AUSTRIA: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Once Turkey is completely neutralized, I plan to make a well-coordinated action against Italy. I would appreciate your support in this endeavor.
  From ENGLAND: Germany, your recent capture of Belgium has made us question our alliance. However, Italy remains the leading power with 7 centers. We need to make a plan to curb Italy's expansion. Can we negotiate a return of Belgium or make a plan to make up for this loss while focusing on Italy?
  From FRANCE: Hello, Germany. Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 still stands. However, as the year is coming to a close, what are your plans for the next year? We need to make sure that Italy does not become too powerful.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. A VIE is for defensive purposes only. Once Turkey is dealt with, a joint plan against France could be a strategic next step. What are your thoughts?
  From RUSSIA: Greetings, let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until Turkey is neutralized. Once Turkey is out, our plan should be to make a joint action against Italy. Please confirm your agreement.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy makes sense. I suggest that once Turkey is out of the picture, we should make a well-coordinated plan to curb Italy's expansion.
  From ENGLAND: Germany, your recent capture of Belgium has made us question our alliance. However, Italy is now the leading power with 7 supply centers and seems to be a growing threat. I propose a temporary truce where we make a plan together against Italy while addressing the issue of Belgium later. What are your thoughts on a joint plan against Italy for the next round?
  From FRANCE: Germany, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. However, it would be beneficial for us to discuss our future relations for the year 1913 once the current pact expires. I hope we can find a way to continue maintaining peaceful relations.
  From ITALY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. My unit in Vienna is for defensive purposes only and does not intend to threaten Munich or Bohemia. My main focus is on neutralizing Turkey first.

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter 1912 Adjustment phase, England should gain one unit due to its recapture of Belgium from Germany, while Germany should lose one unit because of its loss of Belgium. Similarly, France should gain one unit because it captured Rome from Italy, while Italy should lose one unit due to its loss of Rome. However, no centers changed hands specifically during this phase."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 has now expired. I propose that we either renew the non-aggression pact or make a plan for a joint action against Italy. Your unit in A TYR could be a part of a coordinated attack on Italy. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, we need to reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. Italy still has 6 centers and poses a significant threat. Let us make a plan to keep pressure on Italy while making sure our alliance remains strong. What are your plans for this round?
  From FRANCE: I propose a new non-aggression pact for 1913. This will allow us both to focus on other fronts. What do you think?
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. France has a unit in PIE which could be a threat to both Italy and your southern borders. I propose a joint action against France. Once France is contained, we can make a strategic plan for future cooperation against other powers such as England if necessary.
  From RUSSIA: Let us maintain our non-aggression pact until Turkey is neutralized. Once Turkey is out, we should make a joint action against Italy.

  From AUSTRIA: I appreciate your reaffirmation of the non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy makes sense. I am less inclined to make a move against Russia at this point as they are helping us against Turkey. Let us make a plan against Italy once Turkey is out of the picture.
  From ENGLAND: Hello, Germany. Given that Italy is currently a significant threat, I would prefer that we make a plan against Italy for now. Once Italy is sufficiently weakened, we can reassess the situation. What specific moves do you propose for a coordinated attack on Italy?
  From FRANCE: Hello Germany, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. However, I need to focus on the situation with Italy first. Once that is resolved, we can discuss a potential alliance against England.
  From ITALY: Hello Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. My army in Vienna is for defensive purposes only. My main focus is on neutralizing Turkey this round. Once that is done, a new plan should be made where we might need to make strategic moves against France. I hope we can maintain peaceful relations until then.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I appreciate your reaffirmation of the non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Once Turkey is neutralized, I believe that Italy should be our next target because it still has 6 centers and poses a significant threat. However, I am open to discussing a joint action against France once Italy is dealt with.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact is valid until the end of 1913. However, as Turkey is almost neutralized, it might be a good time to discuss what our next steps should be once the pact expires. Italy seems to be a growing threat in the region. Would you be interested in a joint action against Italy once our non-aggression pact ends?
  From ENGLAND: Hello, Germany. Given that Italy still has 6 supply centers and poses a significant threat, it makes sense for us to make a plan against Italy this round. However, I need to address the issue of Belgium which was captured by you previously. Can we make a plan for a potential return or some form of compensation for this loss while we make a joint plan against Italy? What specific moves do you propose for a coordinated attack on Italy this round?
  From FRANCE: We need to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Our units will not make any aggressive moves against you this year, and we hope for the same from your end.
  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913 still stands. Once we make a final push against Turkey and eliminate them, we should discuss a joint action against France, who is a significant threat to us both.
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push to eliminate Turkey this round. Once Turkey is neutralized, the next target should be Italy. We should make a joint action against Italy. What are your thoughts on this plan?

  From FRANCE: Hello Germany, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Our units will remain defensive unless necessary for mutual protection.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. My A VIE unit is for defensive purposes only and will not make any aggressive moves against you. Once Turkey is neutralized, we need to discuss our future plans.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy makes sense. I suggest that you make a move on the northern part of Italy such as TYR or VEN. Let us make a plan for a coordinated action against Italy once Turkey is fully neutralized.

  From AUSTRIA: Our non-aggression pact lasts until the end of 1913. Once Turkey is completely neutralized, it seems our next target should be Italy. How can we best coordinate our actions against Italy once our pact expires? Perhaps your units in BOH could support an attack on VIE.
  From ENGLAND: Germany, France's expanding naval presence is a threat to us both. Let us make a plan to push them back. Can we coordinate an attack on their forces in MAO and BRE? I can support you from NTH and ENG.
  From FRANCE: I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. As we approach the end of the year, it might be useful to discuss what our relationship should look like in 1914. Do you have any thoughts on this?
  From ITALY: We need to make a final push against Turkey this round. Once that's done, we should make a joint action against France. Let's make sure we are coordinated.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Once Turkey is neutralized, I believe a joint action against Italy makes sense given their current power. Let's keep communication open.

  From AUSTRIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy makes sense. Russia has been a cooperative ally against Turkey, so focusing on Italy seems more strategic. How do you propose we coordinate our actions against Italy?
  From ENGLAND: Let us reaffirm our alliance and make a plan against France once Italy is sufficiently weakened. For now, I believe a joint plan against Italy makes sense because they are a significant threat. What are your thoughts on a coordinated action against Italy?
  From FRANCE: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. No aggressive moves against Germany are planned from our side.
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. My unit in Vienna (A VIE) is for defensive purposes only. My main focus is on resolving the situation with Turkey. I have no aggressive intentions towards your units in Tyrolia or elsewhere.
  From RUSSIA: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy seems to be a common goal among many powers. What specific plans do you have for a potential joint action against Italy?

Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: RETREAT / OTHER
CRITICAL: Submit orders appropriate for this phase type (e.g., Retreat or Disband for units needing retreats). Consult rules.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):

  From AUSTRIA: Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913 has served us well. I propose a new non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Additionally, once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy could be beneficial for both of us. You could make a move on VEN from TYR and support any of my moves on TRI. How does that sound?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, France has now reached 7 supply centers and poses a significant threat. Given our Northern Triple alliance, it makes sense for us to make a plan against France. What specific moves do you propose for a coordinated attack on France this round?
  From FRANCE: Germany, our non-aggression pact ended in 1913. I propose a new one until the end of 1914. This should allow us to focus on other threats such as Russia or England. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ITALY: Once Turkey is neutralized, I propose that we make a joint plan against France. France has become a significant threat and has captured Naples and Rome from me. I need your support to counter this threat.
  From RUSSIA: Let us renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a joint action against Italy where you make a move on the northern part of Italy.

  From AUSTRIA: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Ensuring no aggressive moves against each other makes sense for both of us. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a plan against another major power such as France.
  From ENGLAND: France is indeed a significant threat. However, it makes sense to make a final push against Italy first as agreed with France and Austria. Once Italy is neutralized, a joint action against France could be a good next step. What specific moves do you propose for a coordinated attack on Italy this round?
  From FRANCE: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. This has been beneficial for both of us so far and allows us to focus on other fronts.
  From ITALY: I agree to continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. The unit in VEN is primarily for defensive purposes and I have no aggressive intentions against Germany. Let us maintain our peaceful relations.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that our non-aggression pact until Turkey is neutralized has been working well. Once Turkey is out of the game, we should discuss our next steps which should include a well-coordinated attack on Italy. Until then, let us keep our pact intact.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring 1914 Movement phase (S1914M), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it was after the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy.

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring 1914 Movement phase (S1914M), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it was after the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy. The status quo in terms of supply center distribution was maintained once again."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Our non-aggression pact should be extended until the end of 1914. However, once Turkey is neutralized, we need to make a well-coordinated action against Italy. Your unit in TYR could be crucial in supporting an attack on VEN or TRI. What do you think?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, France has become the leading power with 7 supply centers. It is crucial that we make a plan to curb their expansion. The Northern Triple alliance should be reaffirmed and a coordinated plan should be made against France. What specific moves do you propose for a joint action against France?
  From FRANCE: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Let us make sure there are no misunderstandings or conflicts until that agreement ends.
  From ITALY: Germany, our common enemy now seems to be France. They have captured Naples and are threatening Italy's remaining supply centers. Can we work together to push back against France? Any support you can provide would be greatly appreciated.
  From RUSSIA: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Once Turkey is neutralized, we plan a joint action against Italy. Let us know if you need any support from us.

  From AUSTRIA: Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. We should first make a joint action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized, which was our previous plan. However, a joint action against France could be considered once Turkey is out of the game. Let us make a plan for that once we have neutralized Turkey.
  From ENGLAND: Hello, Germany. Given that France is a significant power with 7 supply centers, a joint effort to limit France's expansion makes sense. I appreciate your offer to support any moves against Belgium and Holland. Once Italy is neutralized, a plan against France seems prudent. What specific support can you provide for moves against Belgium and Holland?
  From FRANCE: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. We agree that maintaining a peaceful border is in both our best interests until that point.
  From ITALY: Hello, Germany. My unit in Venice is for defensive purposes only. However, I am open to working together against France once Turkey is neutralized. France has become a leading power with 7 supply centers and poses a significant threat to us both. What do you think about a joint action plan against France?
  From RUSSIA: I want to reaffirm our alliance until Turkey is neutralized. Once Turkey is out of the picture, a joint action against France might make sense given that they have become a significant power with 7 supply centers. What are your thoughts on this plan?

\boxed{"During the Spring 1914 Movement phase (S1914M), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it was after the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy. The status quo in terms of supply center distribution was maintained once again."}

  From ENGLAND: Germany, France currently has 7 supply centers, which makes them a significant threat to us both. Let us reaffirm the Northern Triple alliance and make a joint plan against France. What moves do you propose for this round to curb France's power?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. However, I would like to discuss what happens after 1914. Given that our main focus has been on Italy, what are your thoughts on our future relations once Italy is neutralized?
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, as previously discussed, once Turkey is dealt with, a joint action against France should be our next step. Your units in BUR and TYR could make a move towards French territories such as MAR or PIE. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914 and make a plan for a coordinated attack on France.

  From AUSTRIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Once Turkey is neutralized, I agree that Italy should be the next target. A joint action against Italy where you could make a move on VEN or support an attack on VEN from another direction would be beneficial.
  From ENGLAND: Hello, Germany. Given that France has a significant presence and holds 7 supply centers, it makes sense for us to make a plan against France once Italy is neutralized. However, for now, let us make a concerted effort to weaken Italy first. What specific moves do you propose for a coordinated attack on Italy this round?
  From FRANCE: Hello, Germany. I confirm that our non-aggression pact is in place until the end of 1914. I hope we can continue to honor this agreement until then.
  From ITALY: I am interested in a joint action against France once Turkey is neutralized. For now, my main focus is on making a final push against Turkey. Once that is done, a joint action against France could be a strategic next step.
  From RUSSIA: Hello, the alliance has been strong. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against a major power such as England or France should be discussed. However, making a coordinated action against Italy might make sense first.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914 has now expired. I propose a new non-aggression pact until the end of 1915 and a joint action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. I suggest that you make a move on Italy from the north while I make a move from the east. What do you think?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, Italy has been significantly weakened and now only has 2 supply centers. France now has 7 supply centers, making them a significant threat to us both. Let us make a plan to act against France to prevent them from becoming too dominant. What specific moves do you propose for a coordinated action against France?
  From FRANCE: Hello, Germany. Our non-aggression pact was until the end of 1914. I propose that we renew it for the year 1915. However, I need to make sure you are not planning any aggressive moves against France. Please confirm if you agree.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I want to reassure you that I have no aggressive intentions against you and that A VEN is for defensive purposes only. Given that France has a strong presence in Italy, I propose a joint action against France if you are willing to make a move on France from the north.
  From RUSSIA: Our non-aggression pact should remain until Turkey is neutralized. Once that happens, what should be our next step? France has 7 supply centers and might be a good target for us.

\boxed{"In the Spring 1915 Movement phase (S1915M), no supply centers changed hands. The territorial control thus remained the same as it was after the Fall 1914 Movement phase, where Austria had captured Trieste from Italy. The phase passed without any significant changes in the ownership of supply centers."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I am glad that our non-aggression pact has been extended until the end of 1915. Once Turkey is neutralized, I believe a well-coordinated action against Italy should be our next step. How do you plan to support this? Perhaps a move from BOH to support an attack on VEN from TYR could be a part of the plan.
  From ENGLAND: Germany, France is a significant threat to us both with 7 supply centers. A coordinated attack on France could be beneficial. Your unit in BUR could threaten Paris. What are your thoughts on a joint plan against France?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. I hope that we can continue to respect this agreement and avoid any conflicts until the agreed-upon time.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I want to reassure you that A VEN is only for defensive purposes. However, once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against France could be beneficial for us both. What are your thoughts on this?
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized. We should make sure the non-aggression pact extends until the end of 1915. Once Turkey is out of the game, what are your plans for next steps? A coordinated action against Italy seems logical.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy makes sense. However, England has proposed a joint action against France. Thus, it might be worth discussing a plan for what comes after Italy is neutralized. Let us make sure that our actions are well-coordinated.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, I agree that France has made significant advances and poses a significant threat. Once Turkey is neutralized, a coordinated action against France makes sense. What specific plans do you have for a joint effort to weaken France?
  From FRANCE: Hello Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. However, once the pact expires, I might need to reassess the situation based on the balance of power and the need to make a joint action against a dominant power if one emerges. Let us keep the peace on our borders until then.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I want to reassure you that A VEN is for defensive purposes only and I hope for peaceful interactions. Once Turkey is neutralized, I propose a joint action against France. What are your thoughts on this?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against France could make sense given that France has 7 supply centers. However, a well-coordinated action against Italy might make sense first. What are your thoughts on this plan?

  From ENGLAND: Germany, France now has 7 centers and is a significant threat to us both. It seems like a good time to reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance and make a joint plan against France. What are your plans for this round? Can we work together to check France's expansion?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful and that we do not make any aggressive moves against each other.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reassure you that A VEN is only for defensive purposes. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against France could be a strategic next step. I need your support in making a coordinated move against France.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy seems like a logical next step. Given our units' positions, a coordinated attack on Italy could be very effective. What are your thoughts on such a plan?
  From ENGLAND: Hello Germany, I acknowledge our alliance and plan against France. However, the main focus should be on Italy until Turkey is neutralized. Once that is done, a well-coordinated plan against France can be made. For now, let us make a plan to act against Italy once Turkey is out of the game.
  From FRANCE: Hello Germany, I am also in favor of reaffirming our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. The current situation requires us to keep our borders secure while focusing on other potential threats. I am committed to maintaining peace on our borders until the end of this year.
  From ITALY: Hello Germany, my intentions are peaceful. My main focus is on Turkey and possibly France once Turkey is neutralized. I have no aggressive intentions towards your units.
  From RUSSIA: Hello, I would like to reaffirm our alliance until Turkey is neutralized. Once that is done, the next target should be France, who has 7 centers and poses a significant threat to us all.

  From ENGLAND: Germany, it appears that France is now a significant threat to both of us given their seven supply centers. We need to make a plan to curb their expansion. How do you propose we coordinate our actions against France's units and supply centers such as Paris, Marseille, or even Spain?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. It's important that we maintain our current understanding and avoid any conflicts until the agreed upon time. Let us work together to ensure stability in our borders.
  From ITALY: I need reassurance that your army in TYR is for defensive purposes only, and I hope that we can make a joint action against France once Turkey is completely neutralized.
  From RUSSIA: Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a joint action against France as part of the Northern Triple alliance. Let us plan our next moves carefully.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello, Germany. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. My unit in TYR has peaceful intentions and is not a threat to MUN. I intend to honor our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915.
  From ENGLAND: Hello, Germany. I agree that France has a significant presence in the Mediterranean and poses a significant threat. However, Italy is still a power that needs to be addressed first. Once Italy is sufficiently weakened and Turkey is neutralized, I am open to making a well-coordinated plan against France. For now, let us make sure that Italy is taken care of first.
  From FRANCE: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful until that time. Any future actions post-1915 will need to be renegotiated based on the game state.
  From ITALY: Hello, Germany. I am interested in a non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Given my current position, my main plan for the next round is to make a plan against France once our truce ends. What are your thoughts on a potential joint action against France?
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy could be our next step. Let us make a well-coordinated plan that might involve Austria as well.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Winter 1915 Adjustment phase (W1915A), there were no changes in the ownership of supply centers. England retained control of Brest (BRE) which it had captured from France in the previous phase, while Russia continued to hold Smyrna (SMY) which it had taken from Turkey. The lack of new center captures indicates a period of consolidation where the powers focused on reinforcing their current positions rather than expanding their territories."}

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Winter 1915 Adjustment phase (W1915A), there were no changes in the ownership of supply centers. England retained control of Brest (BRE) which it had captured from France in the previous phase, while Russia continued to hold Smyrna (SMY) which it had taken from Turkey. The lack of new center captures indicates a period of consolidation where the powers focused on reinforcing their current positions rather than expanding their territories."}

  From AUSTRIA: Germany, our non-aggression pact has expired after the end of 1915. It has served us well so far. I would like to propose a new non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. In addition, now that Turkey is neutralized, it might be a good time to make a well-coordinated action against Italy. What are your thoughts?
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, given that France has 6 supply centers and is a direct threat to us both, I propose a joint plan against France. What specific moves do you have in mind for a coordinated action against France this round? It's essential that we act together to prevent France from expanding further.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact expired at the end of 1915. Given the current state of the game, I propose renewing the non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. However, this should be in the context of a broader strategy where we both need to make sure our borders are secure. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, now that Turkey is out of the game, France seems to be a significant threat. I propose that we reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916 and make a joint action against France. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, now that Turkey is neutralized, it's time to make a well-coordinated action against Italy. Once Italy is out of the game, we should make a plan against France. Let us reaffirm our 'Northern Triple' alliance and make a plan to act against France once Italy is neutralized.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Germany, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. A joint action against Italy makes sense given that Italy only has two supply centers and two units. I suggest that we make a well-coordinated plan to eliminate Italy first. Once Italy is out of the game, we can make a plan against another major power such as France or Russia. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From ENGLAND: Hello Germany, I agree that keeping pressure on France makes strategic sense given your plan and our previous discussions. However, it is important to make a well-coordinated plan. I need to make sure that our mutual ally Russia is on board for a joint action against France. What specific moves are you planning for this round?
  From FRANCE: Hello Germany, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. It is important that any actions are well-coordinated so that I can focus on other fronts such as Italy or England. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From ITALY: Hello Germany, my main intentions for this round are to retake lost territories from France such as Rome and Naples. I do not plan any aggressive moves against Germany. Given that I only have two supply centers and two units, I am focusing on regaining strength rather than posing any threat to you.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. It makes sense for us to make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is neutralized. After that, a joint plan against France could be made.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I am glad that Turkey has been neutralized. I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916 if that was previously agreed upon. It seems that Italy should be our next target. Could you make a move on Munich to potentially support an attack on Venice from Trieste or another strategic move? Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, let us reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. France currently has 6 centers and could be a threat. What are your plans for this round? Should we make a joint action against France?
  From FRANCE: Hello, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. Once that period ends, we should discuss our future plans and any potential for continued cooperation.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. Given that France holds Rome and Naples, which are rightfully Italian territories, I propose a joint action against France. Your support in retaking Rome and Naples would be greatly appreciated. Once we have retaken these territories, we can discuss further cooperation. What are your thoughts on a coordinated attack on France?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, Turkey has been eliminated. Our non-aggression pact should be reaffirmed until the end of 1916. Our next target should be Italy. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a well-coordinated action against France. Let us plan a joint action against Italy first.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. My current strategic plan is to make a well-coordinated action against Italy now that Turkey has been neutralized. Let us make sure that our borders remain secure while we make this plan.
  From ENGLAND: Hello, Germany. Our alliance against France seems to be working well. I agree that a coordinated attack on one of France's key centers such as Paris or Marseille makes sense. However, we need to make sure that any actions against France should not make another power too strong. Can we make a specific plan for this round?
  From FRANCE: Hello Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. I have no aggressive intentions against you for now. Let us keep our borders peaceful.
  From ITALY: Hello Germany, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. Regarding A TYR, it seems that there is a misunderstanding as A TYR is actually one of your units. I have no units near Munich and any troop movements I make will be defensive or aimed against another power such as France. I am open to making a joint plan against France if you are interested.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. Our next joint action should be against Italy first. Once Italy is neutralized, a joint action against France could be made. What are your thoughts on making a move on Italy?

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase (W1916A), no supply centers changed ownership. The territorial changes from the Fall 1916 Movement phase (F1916M) were thus finalized, with Germany now holding Holland (gained from England) while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw).}

Phase: S1917M, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase (W1916A), no supply centers changed ownership. The territorial changes from the Fall 1916 Movement phase (F1916M) were thus finalized, with Germany now holding Holland (gained from England) while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw).}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1917M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Germany, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916 has expired. I propose a new non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Additionally, let us make a joint action against Italy where you make a move on MUN (if it makes sense strategically) while I make a move on VEN. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a plan against Russia, who is now the most powerful player with 8 supply centers.
  From ENGLAND: Germany, Russia has now become the leading power with 8 supply centers. Given that they have units near your borders such as A WAR and F STP/NC, it might make sense for us to make a joint plan against them to check their expansion. What are your thoughts on a coordinated action?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, we need to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. However, it might be wise to start discussing what our relations will be once the pact ends. What are your thoughts on a possible extension or a new agreement for 1917 and beyond?
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, let us continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. With France holding Rome and Naples, it makes sense for us to plan a joint action against France where I aim to retake my lost territories. A coordinated attack could make it difficult for France to defend on multiple fronts. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our "Northern Triple" alliance. Once Italy is neutralized, a joint action against France makes sense. We need to make a plan to make a coordinated attack on France.

  From AUSTRIA: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. My main focus is on making a final push against Italy, so I have no aggressive plans for A TYR. Let us keep our northern border secure while we focus on other fronts.
  From ENGLAND: Germany, while a plan against France makes sense, our main concern might be to check Russia's growing power as they now have 8 supply centers. However, a well-coordinated action against France might make sense once we make sure that Italy is sufficiently weakened. What specific moves do you suggest for S1917M?
  From FRANCE: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917.
  From ITALY: Germany, I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. However, I need to clarify that I do not currently have a unit in TYR. My main goal is to maintain my current centers (TUN and VEN) and units (A TUS and F TYS). Given that Russia is the leading power with 8 centers, it might make sense for us to make a joint plan against a common threat such as Russia. What are your thoughts?
  From RUSSIA: Let us continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make new plans for the next year where a joint action against a major power such as France might be necessary to keep a balanced power distribution.

\boxed{The Spring 1917 Movement phase (S1917M) did not result in any changes in supply center ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was after the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase (W1916A), where Germany gained Holland from England while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw).}

  From AUSTRIA: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a plan against the most powerful power, which seems to be Russia. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, Russia has emerged as the leading power with 8 centers. Given that you lost Warsaw to them and we lost Holland to you, it might make sense for us to make a plan against Russia. What are your thoughts on a coordinated action to curb their expansion?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. However, once the pact expires, we need to reassess our relationship based on the current game state. Let us keep the peace until the end of this year.
  From ITALY: Germany, we need to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. I hope that you will not make any aggressive moves towards Rome from PIE. Once Russia is weakened, a plan against France could make sense for us both.
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is neutralized. Once Italy is out, we should make a plan against France as part of our Northern Triple alliance.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Our current plan is to make a final push against Italy. Once Italy is neutralized, a plan against Russia might be necessary due to their growing power. Any support you can provide in this plan would be appreciated.
  From ENGLAND: Hello Germany, I agree that France needs to be kept in check. However, our main priority should be to make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is completely neutralized. Once Italy is out, a joint action against France makes sense. However, any plan should be made in the context of the Northern Triple alliance if Russia is still part of it. What specific moves do you propose for this round?
  From FRANCE: Hello Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. My plans for the next round are primarily focused on neutralizing Italy. Any support against Italy would be appreciated. However, once Italy is out of the picture, our long-term plans might need a reassessment.
  From ITALY: Hello Germany, we appreciate your reaffirmation of the non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Given our precarious situation, any support you can provide against threats from France and Austria would be greatly appreciated. We need to make strategic moves to preserve our remaining centers (TUN and VEN). What kind of support can you offer us for the next round?
  From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, our plans for the next round should be to make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is neutralized. Our non-aggression pact should continue until Italy is out of the game. As for A BOH, it should be used in a way that does not threaten Germany directly. Let us make a plan once Italy is neutralized.

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1917 Retreat phase (S1917R), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was after the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase where Germany gained Holland from England while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw). The retreat phase did not result in any new unit movements or dislodgments, thus maintaining the status quo established in the previous movement phase.}

Could your A PIE make a move on TUS or support an attack on TUS from another unit? Once Italy is neutralized, we need to make a plan against Russia, who is currently the most powerful player.
  From ENGLAND: Germany, Russia is now the leading power with 8 supply centers. It might be in our mutual interest to make a plan against Russia to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb Russia's expansion?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. However, it might be worth discussing what happens after that. Once Italy is neutralized, what are your thoughts on a potential future plan against England?
  From ITALY: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Let us make sure that our units do not conflict.
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is neutralized. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a plan to act against France. The 'Northern Triple' alliance should be reaffirmed.

  From AUSTRIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. I agree that a joint action against Italy should be continued until it is neutralized. Once Italy is out, a plan against Russia might be necessary to prevent it from becoming too dominant.
  From ENGLAND: Hello, Germany. I acknowledge France's significant naval presence in the Atlantic and I agree that we should make sure our actions against France are coordinated. Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917 makes sense. Once Italy is neutralized, a plan should be made to address France's naval strength.
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. My current plans are focused on making a final push against Italy. Any potential actions against another major power will be discussed once Italy is neutralized.
  From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. I have no aggressive intentions towards your unit in Piedmont (PIE). However, I need to make strategic moves to survive and might need your support against other powers such as Russia, which is now the leading power with 8 supply centers.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. The unit in BOH is there to make a well-coordinated action against Italy and there is no intention to make a move on Munich. Once Italy is neutralized, a plan should be made against another major power such as France.

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Winter 1917 Adjustment phase (W1917A), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers remained as it was at the end of the Fall 1917 Movement phase. Thus, England still holds the additional center of Sweden, which it captured from Germany. Italy retains control of Rome, which it took from France, while Austria still holds Venice, which it captured from Italy. The net result is that England has gained one center (Sweden), Austria has gained one center (Venice), Italy has a net change of zero centers (gaining Rome but losing Venice), France has lost one center (Rome), and Germany has lost one center (Sweden).}

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Winter 1917 Adjustment phase (W1917A), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers remained as it was at the end of the Fall 1917 Movement phase. Thus, England still holds the additional center of Sweden, which it captured from Germany. Italy retains control of Rome, which it took from France, while Austria still holds Venice, which it captured from Italy. The net result is that England has gained one center (Sweden), Austria has gained one center (Venice), Italy has a net change of zero centers (gaining Rome but losing Venice), France has lost one center (Rome), and Germany has lost one center (Sweden).}

  From AUSTRIA: Germany, our non-aggression pact has expired at the end of 1917. I propose renewing it until the end of 1918. Once Italy is neutralized, I suggest we make a well-coordinated action against Russia, which has become a major power with 8 supply centers. What are your thoughts?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, we propose renewing our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Given that Italy is on the verge of elimination, it makes sense for us to keep a stable border until we can address other threats. Let us know your thoughts.
  From ITALY: Given our past non-aggression pacts and the current game state, I propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Italy aims to focus on retaking lost territories such as Venice from Austria. Can we agree to a mutual non-aggression pact until the end of 1918?
  From RUSSIA: Let's continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918 and make a well-coordinated action against France once Italy is neutralized. What are your thoughts?

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1918M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello Germany, I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. A coordinated action against Italy until it is neutralized makes sense. Once Italy is out, a joint action against Russia might be necessary given their significant power.
  From ENGLAND: Germany, while a plan against France makes sense, our main priority should be to make sure that Italy is neutralized first. Once Italy is out, a well-coordinated action against Russia might be a more strategic move given their dominant position with 8 supply centers. What specific moves do you propose for this round against Italy?
  From FRANCE: Germany, I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. My main focus for this round is to make sure that Italy is neutralized. I hope that our non-aggression pact allows us both to focus on other pressing matters.
  From ITALY: Hello Germany, I accept your proposal to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Given the current situation, my main plan is to defend my remaining centers and units. Any support or non-aggression from your part is greatly appreciated.
  From RUSSIA: Germany, I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Since Turkey is already neutralized, once Italy is also neutralized, a plan against France makes sense. France seems to be a common target mentioned by both Austria and us. What are your thoughts on making a plan against France once Italy is neutralized?

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1918 Movement phase (S1918M), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was at the end of the Winter 1917 Adjustment phase. England still holds Sweden (which it captured from Germany), Italy still holds Rome (which it captured from France), and Austria still holds Venice (which it captured from Italy). The net result is that England has one additional center (Sweden), Austria has one additional center (Venice), Italy has a net change of zero centers (gaining Rome but losing Venice), France has lost one center (Rome), and Germany has lost one center (Sweden).}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Once Italy is neutralized, I believe that a well-coordinated action against Russia should be made. Russia currently has 8 supply centers and a significant military presence in the Balkans and Central Europe. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From ENGLAND: Germany, Russia has now emerged as a significant power with 8 supply centers and 8 units. It might be time for us to make a plan to make sure that Russia does not become too dominant. What are your thoughts on a joint plan to check Russia's power?
  From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. It has been beneficial for both of us thus far.
  From ITALY: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Let us make sure we avoid any conflicts.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, as per our 'Northern Triple' alliance, once Italy is neutralized, we should make a well-coordinated action against France. We need to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. What are your thoughts on a joint action against France once Italy is out of the game?

  From AUSTRIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. I agree that a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is neutralized makes sense. Once Italy is out of the game, we should make a plan against another major power such as Russia.
  From ENGLAND: I agree that once Italy is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Russia makes sense given their current power with 8 supply centers and a significant military presence. However, we need to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant, so a plan should be made against any power that becomes too strong, which could include Russia or even France.
  From FRANCE: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Let us continue our peaceful relations.
  From ITALY: Germany, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Let us continue our peaceful relations.
  From RUSSIA: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. A well-coordinated action against Italy until it is neutralized makes sense. My unit in Tyrolia is there primarily to make a move against Italy such as supporting an attack on Venice or making a move on Tuscany. Once Italy is neutralized, we need to make a plan for the next steps.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918 stands. Once Italy is out, we need to make a plan against Russia who seems to be a significant threat with 8 supply centers.
  From ENGLAND: Germany, Italy is now almost out of the game. The main threat now appears to be Russia, which has 8 centers and 8 units. I propose a joint action against Russia once Italy is completely neutralized. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From FRANCE: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful and that no aggressive moves are made.
  From ITALY: Germany, Italy is in a precarious position and seeks a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Our main goal is to retake Rome and Naples from France. A non-aggression pact would allow us to focus on that goal without worrying about a conflict with you. Can we agree on this?
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is completely neutralized. Once Italy is out, we should make a plan against France as part of our Northern Triple alliance.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918.
  From ENGLAND: Hello, Germany. A coordinated plan against France could be considered once Italy is neutralized. However, once Italy is out, the main threat might be Russia due to their significant number of units and supply centers. Let us make a plan for a well-coordinated action against Italy first.
  From FRANCE: Hello, Germany. I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. However, what are your thoughts on what happens after 1918 ends?
  From ITALY: Thank you for reaffirming the non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Given Italy's current precarious position, our main plan is to make a last stand where possible and seek a safe haven until the game ends. Any strategic support or mutual defense pact against France or Austria would be greatly appreciated.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Our unit in TYR is primarily for making a well-coordinated action against Italy and we have no aggressive intentions against Germany. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a plan against another major power such as France.

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

Phase: F1925M, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_1

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}
