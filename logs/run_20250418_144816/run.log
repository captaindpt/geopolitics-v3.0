[2025-04-18 15:01:40.021]             From GERMANY: Hello Austria, I agree to a non-aggression pact where we both focus on other fronts. I am open to working together against Russia or Italy if the need arises. Let us keep communication open and coordinate our actions if a common threat emerges.
[2025-04-18 15:01:40.021]             From ITALY: Hello Austria, I agree with a non-aggression pact and am open to working together against Turkey. To make a coordinated move, I suggest that you move towards Serbia and Greece while I move my fleet from Naples to the Ionian Sea (NAP to ION) as a first step towards a potential action against Turkey. We should support each other's moves where necessary. What do you think?
[2025-04-18 15:01:40.021]             From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I find your proposal for a joint action against Turkey quite appealing. I agree that focusing on Bulgaria and Rumania makes sense for me while you aim for Greece and Serbia. Let us make sure our actions are well coordinated.

[2025-04-18 15:01:40.021]             From GERMANY: Hello England, I agree to a non-aggression pact where F KIE stays out of HEL and F LON does not threaten our North Sea borders. I think focusing on France could be a mutually beneficial strategy. Perhaps we can discuss a coordinated action against France?
[2025-04-18 15:01:40.021]             From RUSSIA: Dear England, your proposal for a peaceful division of Scandinavia sounds reasonable. I agree that I should aim for Sweden while you aim for Norway. I suggest that you keep your fleets out of Sweden while I keep my fleet out of Norway. This should allow us both to expand without conflict.

I am open to a non-aggression pact for this turn where neither of us moves into the English Channel. However, for a long-term plan, I believe we need to further discuss how we can mutually benefit from our geographical positions. What are your thoughts on a more structured long-term alliance?
[2025-04-18 15:01:40.021]             From GERMANY: Hello France, I agree to a non-aggression pact so that we can focus on other regions. I might focus on the east while you focus on the west. Let us avoid early conflicts and support each other in our respective regions.
[2025-04-18 15:01:40.021]             From ITALY: Hello France, I agree to a non-aggression pact where I focus on the Eastern Mediterranean and possibly against Austria while you focus on the north and west. To ensure mutual non-aggression, I suggest that I avoid moving towards the Western Mediterranean and that you avoid moving towards the Italian mainland. How does that sound?

[2025-04-18 15:01:40.022]             From FRANCE: I am open to a non-aggression pact in the Western Mediterranean. If your main focus is on Austria or Turkey, that works well for us. Let's keep our border peaceful.

[2025-04-18 15:01:40.023]             From ENGLAND: Hello Russia, I find your proposal for a Northern Triple alliance with Germany intriguing. An alliance to divide Scandinavia sounds like a viable plan. However, I need to confirm that Germany is also part of this plan. Once we have a three-way agreement, I am open to moving my fleet from London to the North Sea while you move your fleet from St. Petersburg to the Gulf of Bothnia. Let us make sure that Germany is on board as well.
[2025-04-18 15:01:40.023]             From FRANCE: I am interested in a Franco-Russian alliance against Germany. A MAR to Burgundy makes sense. However, could you provide a more detailed plan on how we can effectively put pressure on Germany? For instance, what would be our next steps if I move A MAR to Burgundy and you move A WAR to Galicia?
[2025-04-18 15:01:40.023]             From GERMANY: Hello Russia, I am interested in working together against Austria. However, a direct move to Tyrolia might be too aggressive initially. I suggest I move A MUN to Silesia or Bohemia while you move A WAR to Galicia. This way, we can make a coordinated yet cautious move against Austria.
[2025-04-18 15:01:40.023]             From TURKEY: Hello Russia, I am interested in your Juggernaut alliance proposal. Moving A CON to Bulgaria sounds like a good plan to pressure Austria.

I am open to discussing this further where I focus on Galicia and Vienna while you aim for Greece and Serbia. However, I need to make a final decision based on other diplomatic discussions as well.

\boxed{The game has just started with the Spring 1901 Movement phase. As this is the first phase of the game, all seven powers (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey) have made their initial moves. However, no specific key events or state changes are mentioned other than the fact that the game has started. Thus, the main event here is that the game has officially commenced and all powers have made their first set of moves for the Spring 1901 Movement phase.}

[2025-04-18 15:15:30.879]             From RUSSIA: I am still open to a non-aggression pact and a potential alliance against Austria where I focus on Galicia and Vienna while you aim for Greece and Serbia. However, I need to make sure that our actions are well-coordinated. What are your plans for this round?

[2025-04-18 15:23:37.685]             From FRANCE: I appreciate your openness to a long-term structured alliance and mutual non-aggression in the English Channel. To make our cooperation more concrete, I propose that we agree that England keeps its fleets out of the English Channel (specifically, no moves into ENG or MAO), while I keep my fleets out of the English Channel (i.e., no moves into ENG). Additionally, a joint plan against Germany could be beneficial. For instance, if I move A BUR to BEL, could you support me by moving A YOR to BEL (which might need a convoy from F NTH)? This would help us both gain a strategic advantage against Germany.
[2025-04-18 15:23:37.685]             From GERMANY: Hello England, here is a more detailed plan for our alliance against France and Russia. For the next move, I propose that my fleet in Denmark (F DEN) moves to the Heligoland Bight (HEL) or alternatively, my army in Kiel (A KIE) supports F DEN to HEL if needed. I suggest that your fleet in the North Sea (F NTH) moves to HEL or supports F DEN to HEL. This will help us secure the North Sea and potentially make a joint move against France from the North while I focus on a land assault on France's borders. What are your thoughts on this plan?
[2025-04-18 15:23:37.685]             From RUSSIA: Hello England, yes, Germany is part of the Northern Triple alliance plan. I aim for Sweden while you aim for Norway. It is important that we keep Germany in the loop so that our actions are well-coordinated. Let us make sure that Germany is on board with this plan as well.

However, I would like to discuss a more long-term structured alliance where we can support each other against other powers such as Germany or Russia. What are your thoughts on a potential alliance?
[2025-04-18 15:23:37.685]             From GERMANY: Greetings France, I agree with your proposal for a non-aggression pact where both of us agree not to attack each other for the first few turns.

I plan to keep my fleets in the North Sea (NTH) and Norwegian Sea (NWG) for potential support against France. However, I need a more specific plan from you on how you plan to support us against France and what your intentions are for the next few turns. Can you provide more details on your strategy?
[2025-04-18 15:23:37.685]             From FRANCE: I appreciate your question about specific areas where I need a guarantee that you will not make a move. I would appreciate a guarantee that Germany will not make a move into Belgium (BEL) or Burgundy (BUR) this round. I plan to focus on the west, which might involve a potential conflict with England, so I need assurance that you will not make any aggressive moves towards my borders.
[2025-04-18 15:23:37.685]             From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, I am glad that you are open to a non-aggression pact. My main focus for the next few turns is on the south against Turkey and Austria. I aim to secure Bulgaria and Rumania while also making sure that our northern borders remain peaceful. Let us keep in touch and make sure that any actions are well-coordinated.

[2025-04-18 15:23:37.685]             From AUSTRIA: I confirm our non-aggression pact where you focus on the Mediterranean while I focus on the Balkans. I plan to secure Serbia and possibly move towards Greece. Can you ensure that your fleet in ION does not move into the Adriatic Sea or towards Greece?
[2025-04-18 15:23:37.685]             From FRANCE: I confirm our non-aggression pact. I plan to focus on the west, which might involve a potential conflict with England or Germany. I suggest that you focus on the Mediterranean and possibly the Balkans while I handle the west. Do you have any specific plans for the Mediterranean that might require any form of indirect support or coordination from me?
[2025-04-18 15:23:37.686]             From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I agree that a non-aggression pact can benefit us both by allowing us to focus on our immediate neighbors. My plans for this round are to ensure peaceful borders while focusing on my immediate neighbors such as France and Russia. I hope we can maintain a peaceful border and perhaps coordinate if an opportunity arises against a common threat.
[2025-04-18 15:23:37.686]             From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I confirm our non-aggression pact. I plan to focus on the Black Sea and Armenia while you focus on the Western Mediterranean. My plan for this round is to move A SMY to CON and A BUL to either SER or GRE. Let us keep our communication open and avoid any early conflict.

[2025-04-18 15:23:37.686]             From ENGLAND: I reaffirm our agreement on the peaceful division of Scandinavia where you aim for Sweden while I aim for Norway. However, it is important that any aggressive moves towards the North Sea (NTH) or Norwegian Sea (NWG) would be seen as a breach of trust. Let us continue to respect this agreement.
[2025-04-18 15:23:37.686]             From FRANCE: I am interested in your proposal for a non-aggression pact and a potential alliance against a common threat such as Germany or England. Could you provide a more detailed plan on how you envision such an alliance and what specific actions you propose for the current round?
[2025-04-18 15:23:37.686]             From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact for the current year. Let us continue to respect each other's borders and focus on our respective goals. I trust that we can maintain a peaceful border.
[2025-04-18 15:23:37.686]             From ITALY: Hello Russia, I agree to a non-aggression pact for the current year. I am open to discussing a potential alliance against Turkey. However, I need to make sure that any such alliance does not conflict with other existing agreements.
[2025-04-18 15:23:37.686]             From TURKEY: Dear Russia, I confirm our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. I plan to move A SMY to CON and A BUL to either SER or GRE.

[2025-04-18 15:52:20.658]             From GERMANY: Thank you for agreeing to a non-aggression pact. Given that we both face threats from Russia and potentially Italy, it makes sense for us to support each other if one of us is attacked. For now, I plan to make no aggressive moves against you and hope you will do the same.
[2025-04-18 15:52:20.658]             From ITALY: Hello, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact.

[2025-04-18 15:52:20.659]             From FRANCE: Hello England, we need to reaffirm our agreement on the peaceful split of the English Channel. My fleet in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean could move there unless we agree on a joint plan against Germany. How about you focus on the North Sea and Scandinavia while I keep my fleet in the English Channel? Let us make sure that Germany remains our priority target.
[2025-04-18 15:52:20.659]             From GERMANY: We need to make a coordinated effort against France and Russia. Given your fleet in Norway (F NWY), perhaps a joint operation to control the North Sea and Baltic Sea could be beneficial. How about if your F NWY moves to support my F BAL into Sweden (F NWY S F BAL-SWE)? This could help us push back against Russia's F SWE. Additionally, if your F NTH could support an attack on Belgium (F NTH S A RUH-BEL), we could work together to take on France. What do you think?
[2025-04-18 15:52:20.659]             From RUSSIA: Hello England, our peaceful division of Scandinavia seems to be working well so far. I hope we can continue to honor this agreement and avoid any conflicts in the Baltic Sea region.

Germany seems weaker and could be a good target for us both. What do you think about a joint action against Germany this spring?
[2025-04-18 15:52:20.659]             From GERMANY: Our non-aggression pact seems to be holding up well. It makes sense for both of us to focus on our immediate threats.

[2025-04-18 15:52:20.660]             From FRANCE: Hello Germany, we need a solid non-aggression pact and a specific guarantee that you won’t move into Burgundy or Belgium.

Can we agree on a mutual non-aggression pact that includes a promise not to move into Burgundy or Belgium?

[2025-04-18 15:52:20.661]             From GERMANY: While we have agreed on a non-aggression pact, your fleet in Sweden (F SWE) makes me a bit uneasy. Can we agree to a standoff in the Baltic Sea?

[2025-04-18 15:58:58.203]             From ITALY: Hello, thank you for reaching out. Our non-aggression pact stands firm. A TYR is primarily for defensive purposes and to make sure our borders are secure. It might also be used to support action against another power such as Turkey if there is mutual agreement. However, I need to make sure our borders are safe from any potential threats. Could you provide details on your plans for your units in Trieste and Serbia?
[2025-04-18 15:58:58.203]             From RUSSIA: I agree that we should continue our joint action against Turkey. I plan to support your moves against Turkey where possible. For this round, I suggest that A GAL could support your A BUD to hold its position if necessary or make a move on BUL if you support it. F RUM could support an Austrian move into BUL or hold its position to prevent Turkish advances. Let us make sure that our borders remain secure while we make gains against Turkey.

I propose that you move your F NTH to support my A BEL to hold its position while I move A BEL to support your A YOR to move into HOL. This way, we can put pressure on Germany from multiple fronts. What do you think?
[2025-04-18 15:58:58.203]             From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance plan and the division of Scandinavia.

Let us keep our alliance strong and focus on our respective goals.

It makes sense for us to focus on the North Sea and Scandinavia while you keep a fleet in the English Channel. However, let us make sure that any fleet in the English Channel is used for mutual defense against Germany rather than as a potential threat to us. Germany should indeed remain our priority target.
[2025-04-18 15:58:58.203]             From ITALY: Hello, our non-aggression pact is important to me as well. I agree that focusing on Austria makes sense given your plans for Germany and England. Could you share more details on how you plan to handle Germany and England? Additionally, what are your plans for the Mediterranean region? I need to make sure our mutual interests are aligned.
[2025-04-18 15:58:58.203]             From RUSSIA: I am interested in a long-term alliance where you focus on Germany while I focus on Austria and Turkey.

I plan to make no aggressive moves against you and hope that we can support each other if one of us is attacked. Given that Russia appears to be a mutual threat, I would appreciate any support you can provide against them.
[2025-04-18 15:58:58.203]             From ENGLAND: Hello Germany, I acknowledge the need for a coordinated effort against France and Russia. However, I propose a slightly different plan. How about if your A RUH supports my F NTH into Belgium (A RUH S F NTH-BEL) while I support your F BAL into Sweden (F NWY S F BAL-SWE)? This way, we can make a joint effort against both France and Russia while making sure that our actions are well-coordinated.
[2025-04-18 15:58:58.203]             From FRANCE: Germany, our non-aggression pact is indeed holding up well. I agree that focusing on our immediate threats makes sense. I need assurance that your A RUH will not make any aggressive moves towards my A BEL or BUR. A mutual standoff in Belgium sounds reasonable for this round if you agree to keep A RUH where it is.
[2025-04-18 15:58:58.203]             From ITALY: Hello, our non-aggression pact is working well indeed. I assure you that I have no plans to threaten Munich right now. A TYR might be used for a defensive position or possibly to make a move against Austria if there is a mutual agreement. However, I need to make sure that our borders remain secure. What are your current plans for Berlin and Ruhr?
[2025-04-18 15:58:58.204]             From RUSSIA: I agree to a standoff in the Baltic Sea where your F BAL stays in place and my F SWE does not make aggressive moves towards you. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and focus on our respective goals elsewhere.

[2025-04-18 15:58:58.204]             From AUSTRIA: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. I am open to discussing a coordinated action against Turkey. However, it's important that any plan we make ensures that our mutual non-aggression remains intact. For instance, if you could focus on supporting any potential move against Turkey from the south while I focus on the north, that might be a viable strategy. However, I need assurances that your units won't make any moves towards Tyrolia or Trieste.
[2025-04-18 15:58:58.204]             From FRANCE: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. For further cooperation in the Mediterranean, I suggest that you focus on the eastern part while I focus on the western part. Perhaps you could consider moving your F TUN to the Ionian Sea while I keep my F MAO in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean. This way, we can both expand our influence in the Mediterranean without clashing.

[2025-04-18 15:58:58.204]             From ENGLAND: Hello Russia, I agree that our peaceful division of Scandinavia seems to be working well so far. I hope we can continue to honor this agreement and avoid any conflicts in the Baltic Sea region. Let us make sure that our actions are well-coordinated so that we do not make a new enemy while trying to maintain a stable northern front.
[2025-04-18 15:58:58.204]             From FRANCE: Russia, our previous discussions about a non-aggression pact and a potential alliance against Germany or England are still on the table. To support each other this round, I suggest that you put pressure on Germany from the east while I do so from the west. Perhaps you could move your F SWE to support an attack on Denmark while I make moves against Germany's western front.
[2025-04-18 15:58:58.204]             From ITALY: Hello, our non-aggression pact is still on the table.

\boxed{"In the Spring 1902 Movement phase, no supply centers changed hands. The new units built by France, England, Turkey, and Italy (one unit each), and Austria and Russia (two units each) were likely deployed during this phase, although specific troop movements are not detailed here. The lack of supply center captures indicates that the powers may have focused on consolidating their positions and making strategic maneuvers without directly capturing any new territories."}

We need to contact Russia to refine our joint action against Turkey. Additionally, reaffirming the non-aggression pact with Italy and exploring potential joint actions against Turkey makes sense. Finally, reaffirming the non-aggression pact with Germany could be useful but is not our main priority.

[2025-04-18 16:14:10.873]             From AUSTRIA: It seems that no new supply centers were captured in the Spring 1902 Movement phase. We need to make a more coordinated effort against Turkey for the Fall 1902 Movement phase. I propose that I move A VIE -> GAL if you can support this move or move your A GAL elsewhere. A BUD can support A VIE -> GAL if necessary. A SER can move to BUL if your F RUM supports that move or moves to BUL itself. F AEG can attack Smyrna or support a potential move to Constantinople. What are your thoughts on this plan?
[2025-04-18 16:14:10.874]             From ENGLAND: Russia, I see that you have a fleet in Sweden. What are your plans for this unit? I want to make sure that our previous agreement on a peaceful division of Scandinavia still holds true.
[2025-04-18 16:14:10.874]             From FRANCE: Dear Russia, I hope our non-aggression pact is still valid. I would like to make sure that any coordinated action against Germany is still on the table. If you are still interested, let us plan a joint action to keep Germany in check. What are your thoughts on this?
[2025-04-18 16:14:10.874]             From GERMANY: Hello, Russia. Our previous agreement included a non-aggression pact where we respect each other’s borders and focus on our respective goals. I want to reaffirm that pact and make sure that any mutual support against other powers still holds. Your units in Sweden and Galicia seem poised for action; what are your current plans?
[2025-04-18 16:14:10.874]             From ITALY: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I am considering a joint action against either Austria or Turkey. Would you be interested in coordinating an attack on Austria? For instance, if you could support an attack on TRI or VIE, it could be beneficial for both of us. Alternatively, if you prefer, we could also coordinate against Turkey where my fleet in ION could support an attack on BUL or CON.
[2025-04-18 16:14:10.874]             From TURKEY: Dear Russia, our Juggernaut alliance against Austria seems to be progressing well. I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. Could you move A GAL to BUD supported by A UKR? Additionally, what are your plans for dealing with the Austrian fleet in AEG? It seems like a potential threat to both of us.

[2025-04-18 16:14:10.874]             From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I am open to discussing any strategic moves that could be mutually beneficial.
[2025-04-18 16:14:10.874]             From RUSSIA: Let us continue our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. I plan to support your A BUL to SER while I make a move from A GAL to BUD. How does that sound?

[2025-04-18 16:20:35.425]             From FRANCE: I agree that Germany still poses a significant threat. I plan to move A BUR to RUH if Germany makes any aggressive moves. However, I need assurance that F NTH will not make any aggressive moves against F BRE or F MAO. Let us make sure that our fleets coordinate so that F BRE could support an attack on the English Channel if necessary. How do you plan to support our joint plan against Germany?
[2025-04-18 16:20:35.425]             From GERMANY: Given that Russia already has a fleet in Sweden, a coordinated action seems necessary. How about you support my F BAL into Sweden while your F NWY could also support the move or make a move to support us against France? For instance, your F NTH could move to ENG to threaten France's F BRE or support an attack against BUR if needed.

[2025-04-18 16:20:35.426]             From ENGLAND: Dear France, I am glad that our non-aggression pact for the English Channel is holding strong. I am open to a coordinated attack on Germany. Could you provide a more detailed plan on how you plan to make your moves against Germany and what specific support you need from us? For instance, what moves do you plan for your A BUR and A HOL units? We need a well-coordinated plan.
[2025-04-18 16:20:35.426]             From GERMANY: Our non-aggression pact still stands. However, the unit in BUR makes me a bit uneasy as it could be seen as a threat to RUH. Can we make a mutual standoff where your A BUR does not make aggressive moves towards RUH while my A RUH stays put or makes a non-threatening move such as A RUH -> BUR (supporting hold)?
[2025-04-18 16:20:35.426]             From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact is still in place and I am glad to continue our cooperation in the Mediterranean.

[2025-04-18 16:20:35.426]             From AUSTRIA: Thank you for your message. We reaffirm our non-aggression pact and appreciate your offer to coordinate against Russia. However, our current focus is a joint action against Turkey with Russia. If Russia makes any aggressive actions towards us, such as moving into Galicia, we could be open to a future alliance against Russia.
[2025-04-18 16:20:35.426]             From ENGLAND: Greetings Germany, your proposal for us to support F BAL-SWE and A RUH-BEL seems interesting. However, it seems that most of the gains would be on your part. Could we make a more balanced plan where we make equal gains? For instance, what if our F NTH moves into Belgium while your A RUH supports us (F NTH-BEL supported by A RUH)? As for Sweden, supporting your F BAL move into Sweden makes us a bit uneasy because it makes you stronger and us not gaining anything directly. What can you offer in return for such support?
[2025-04-18 16:20:35.426]             From FRANCE: The non-aggression pact is still valid. The army in Holland is primarily for defensive purposes and to secure the region against potential threats from other powers such as England. I propose a mutual standoff where you do not make any aggressive moves against Holland or Belgium while I do not make any aggressive moves against Ruh or Munich. Let us continue to respect each other's borders.
[2025-04-18 16:20:35.426]             From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact is still valid where you focus on France and Russia while I focus on Austria. My army in Tyrolia is part of my strategic positioning which could be for defensive measures or preemptive action against Austria if necessary.

One such action could be if your unit F ION supports our unit F AEG in a potential attack on Smyrna. Are you open to this?
[2025-04-18 16:20:35.426]             From FRANCE: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I am interested in a joint action against Austria if it does not conflict with our main focus on Germany. However, our main focus is on Germany. If you make a specific plan for attacking Austria, let me know what kind of support you need from France. However, any support should be carefully coordinated so that it does not weaken our position against Germany.
[2025-04-18 16:20:35.426]             From GERMANY: Our non-aggression pact remains valid. I hope we can continue to maintain peace and cooperation. Your unit in TYR makes me a bit cautious, so let us make sure our borders remain peaceful.

[2025-04-18 16:20:35.427]             From AUSTRIA: We agree with the plan where A VIE moves to Galicia if supported by you or if A GAL moves elsewhere. A BUD will support A VIE to Galicia. A SER should move to Bulgaria if supported by F RUM. F AEG can either attack Smyrna or support a potential move to Constantinople.
[2025-04-18 16:20:35.427]             From ENGLAND: Dear Russia, I agree that the Northern Triple alliance is working well. I plan to keep my fleet in Norway while you keep your fleet in Sweden. However, it might be wise for us to make some aggressive moves against Germany or France. Do you have any plans to make any such moves this round? Your support might be crucial.
[2025-04-18 16:20:35.427]             From FRANCE: I reaffirm our long-term alliance where I focus on Germany while you focus on Austria and Turkey. It would be helpful if you could make a move against Germany if possible, such as by pressuring Berlin or supporting any French moves against Munich or Ruh. Let us keep supporting each other.
[2025-04-18 16:20:35.427]             From GERMANY: Our non-aggression pact remains valid. I agree to a standoff in the Baltic Sea where my F BAL stays in place if your F SWE does not make aggressive moves.

\boxed{"In the Fall 1902 Movement phase, despite the active deployment of new units built previously by France, England, Turkey, Italy, Austria, and Russia, no supply centers changed hands. This suggests that the powers may have been engaged in strategic maneuvers or defensive actions that did not result in the capture of any new territories. The phase thus appears to be a continuation of the previous one where the focus was on consolidating positions and making strategic moves without immediate territorial gains."}

The French unit in KIE is a major concern for us. I am also trying to clarify a dispute with Russia over Sweden. Any support or coordination against Russia would be welcome.
[2025-04-18 16:42:36.320]             From ITALY: Hello, thank you for the update. Our non-aggression pact is indeed holding. Currently, I do not have a fleet in the Ionian Sea (F ION) to support any action against Turkey. However, once I establish a fleet there, I am open to discussing such coordinated actions. Let us keep up the good work.
[2025-04-18 16:42:36.320]             From RUSSIA: Hello Austria, it seems that our joint action against Turkey did not result in any new supply center changes, largely due to defensive actions by Turkey and Italy's intervention in the Balkans. However, let us reaffirm our alliance against Turkey and make a new plan for the next year where you aim for Greece and Serbia while I aim for Bulgaria and Rumania. Let us make a coordinated effort in Spring 1903.

Let us continue to coordinate our efforts. I plan on holding KIE for now unless there is a strategic reason to vacate it. What are your next moves against Germany?
[2025-04-18 16:42:36.320]             From GERMANY: Hello England. I understand that you are currently allied with France against me. However, I would like to make a peace offer that makes sense for both of us. If you are open to it, I could support your fleet in the North Sea and perhaps we could make a joint effort against France who currently holds five supply centers. Working together might help us both grow stronger.
[2025-04-18 16:42:36.320]             From ITALY: Hello, England. I am open to potential cooperation where our interests align.

What are your thoughts?
[2025-04-18 16:42:36.320]             From RUSSIA: Hello England, the fleet in Sweden is part of our previously agreed-upon peaceful division of Scandinavia where you aim for Norway while I aim for Sweden.

[2025-04-18 16:42:36.320]             From GERMANY: Hello France. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, the presence of your unit in KIE is a significant concern. A true non-aggression pact should perhaps involve a French retreat from KIE. I hope that we can continue to maintain a peaceful border once this issue is resolved.

I am open to a joint plan against France, but we need to make sure that Russia does not make any aggressive moves against us once France is weakened. What is your plan?
[2025-04-18 16:42:36.320]             From FRANCE: Hello Germany, I understand your concern about my unit in KIE. My actions were part of a broader strategic plan that requires us to hold KIE for now. However, I am open to discussing a peaceful resolution that could be beneficial for both of us in the near future. Let us keep communication open.
[2025-04-18 16:42:36.320]             From ITALY: Hello, Germany. Yes, I have an army in Vienna due to a conflict with Austria. However, our non-aggression pact remains in place, and I assure you that our borders will remain peaceful. My actions against Austria should not be interpreted as a threat to Germany.
[2025-04-18 16:42:36.320]             From RUSSIA: Hello Germany, the fleet in Sweden is part of a defensive posture, and I intend to respect our non-aggression pact. However, any aggressive moves by you against me will be met with a strong response. Let us maintain peace.

Currently, my fleet is in SWE and it seems there is a mention of a unit of yours there as well. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and make it clear that a part of that pact should include a standoff line in the Baltic Sea where neither of us makes aggressive moves against Sweden.

\boxed{"In the Fall 1902 Retreat phase, significant territorial changes occurred. Germany captured Sweden and Warsaw from Russia, but lost Kiel to France. France thus gained Kiel from Germany. Austria lost Trieste and Vienna to Italy, which expanded its influence by gaining these two centers. This phase marked a significant realignment of power among the European powers."}

Message England for support against France. Reaffirm non-aggression pacts with Italy and Russia while checking their intentions in VIE and STP/MOS respectively.

[2025-04-18 17:03:22.133]             From FRANCE: Dear England, let us reaffirm our joint plan against Germany. I propose that your fleet in the English Channel (F ENG) supports my fleet in Brest (F BRE) to hold its position or move to another strategic location such as the Mid-Atlantic Ocean (MAO) if necessary. Meanwhile, your fleet in the North Sea (F NTH) could be used to support an attack on the North Sea or another strategic location. Let us keep the English Channel peaceful and focus on our common goal against Germany.

Additionally, any joint action against France could help us both expand and secure our positions.

[2025-04-18 17:03:22.134]             From GERMANY: Dear France, I noticed that you have an army in KIE. Our non-aggression pact suggests that you focus on the west while I focus on the east. Could we discuss your plans for A KIE? I propose that you move it elsewhere such as to support against England or Italy, and I could offer some form of support in another part of the board. Let us work together to make sure our borders are secure and our pact remains strong.
[2025-04-18 17:03:22.134]             From ITALY: Hello, France. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Do you have any strategic suggestions or need any support in the Mediterranean? I aim to make a move against Turkey or Austria and would appreciate any advice or support you might offer.
[2025-04-18 17:03:22.134]             From RUSSIA: France, let us reaffirm our long-term alliance where you focus on Germany while I focus on Austria and Turkey. However, Italy seems to be growing stronger. Should we consider a joint action against Italy if they make any aggressive moves?

[2025-04-18 17:03:22.134]             From ENGLAND: Hello, how is the situation on your end? Given the growing power of France, what are your plans for defense?
[2025-04-18 17:03:22.134]             From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact and the mutual standoff in Belgium. It is important that your unit in Ruh (A RUH) does not move into Belgium or Burgundy. Any aggressive moves towards these regions would be met with a strong response. Let us keep our agreement intact and focus on other threats.
[2025-04-18 17:03:22.134]             From ITALY: Hello, Germany. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Is there any specific action you need support with? I aim to make a safe and strategic move this round.
[2025-04-18 17:03:22.134]             From RUSSIA: Germany, let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I need to make sure that your fleet in SWE does not make any aggressive moves towards STP. What are your plans for F SWE this turn?

[2025-04-18 17:03:22.134]             From AUSTRIA: Hello, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. Given that your units are in VIE and TRI, close to my units in BUD and SER, could you share your intentions for this season? I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding.
[2025-04-18 17:03:22.134]             From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact and suggest a joint action against Germany. Given your unit in Vienna (A VIE), a joint action against Munich (A MUN) could be a viable plan where you move A VIE to Tyrolia (TYR) and potentially support my unit in Burgundy (A BUR) to move into Munich. What are your thoughts on this plan?
[2025-04-18 17:03:22.134]             From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Could you let me know your intentions for A VIE and A TRI? I want to make sure that our focus remains on our mutual agreements and that any actions taken do not violate our agreement.
[2025-04-18 17:03:22.134]             From RUSSIA: Italy, let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and coordinated action against Turkey where you make moves against Smyrna while I make moves against Bulgaria and Constantinople. However, what are your plans for A VIE this turn?
[2025-04-18 17:03:22.134]             From TURKEY: Dear Italy, it seems that you have made significant gains against Austria by capturing VIE and TRI. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and suggest that we continue to work together to eliminate Austria completely. I plan to move A BUL to SER and possibly A CON to support that move. Could you make a move against Austria's remaining supply center in GRE? For instance, if you move F GRE to AEG (if you have a fleet there) or make a move from A VIE or A TRI to support any of our moves against SER or GRE, that would be helpful. What are your thoughts on this plan?

[2025-04-18 17:03:22.134]             From AUSTRIA: Hello, let's continue our joint action against Turkey. I propose that my A SER moves to BUL this turn. Would your F RUM support this move? Also, what are your plans for A UKR? I need to make sure that our actions are well-coordinated.
[2025-04-18 17:03:22.135]             From ENGLAND: Let us continue to honor the Northern Triple alliance terms and keep Scandinavia peaceful. What are your plans for the current season?
[2025-04-18 17:03:22.135]             From FRANCE: Dear Russia, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact and propose a coordinated action against Germany. You could move your unit in Moscow (A MOS) to Warsaw (WAR) or your unit in Ukraine (A UKR) to Galicia (GAL) to put pressure on Germany's unit in Warsaw (A WAR). This would help us in our joint efforts against Germany.
[2025-04-18 17:03:22.135]             From GERMANY: Dear Russia, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. What are your plans for A STP and A MOS? It is important for me to ensure that any movements in the Baltic or towards Warsaw are peaceful. Let us keep our focus on our respective goals and respect our borders.
[2025-04-18 17:03:22.135]             From ITALY: Hello, Russia. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Would you be interested in a joint action against Turkey? I could move my fleet from NAP to ION and aim for AEG if you support by attacking Turkey from RUM. Let us discuss how we can make a coordinated move.
[2025-04-18 17:03:22.135]             From TURKEY: Dear Russia, it seems that our previous attempts to take BUD and SER were unsuccessful. However, Austria is now in a very weak position with only three supply centers left. Let us continue our Juggernaut alliance and make a new round of coordinated attacks. I suggest that you move A UKR to support A BUL to SER while I move A BUL to SER. Additionally, if you can move F RUM to support A BUL to GRE, that would help us secure another supply center. What are your thoughts on this plan?

[2025-04-18 17:03:22.135]             From RUSSIA: Turkey, let us reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance against Austria where you aim for Greece and Serbia while I make moves to support your A BUL to SER.

Let us keep our lines of communication open for any potential cooperation against other powers.
[2025-04-18 17:24:42.867]             From RUSSIA: I agree that we should continue our joint action against Turkey. However, instead of A SER moving to BUL, which leaves SER undefended, I suggest that A SER holds while A UKR supports A BUD to BUL if you make that move. F RUM will hold its position to prevent any Turkish advances into RUM.

[2025-04-18 17:24:42.868]             From FRANCE: Thank you for your message. To make a coordinated attack against Germany, I propose that your F NTH supports my F BRE to move into the English Channel (ENG) while your F ENG could move into the North Sea (NTH). Meanwhile, my A KIE could attack HOL or RUH if supported properly by my A BUR. Let us make a plan to dislodge the German fleet in SWE and make a push into their heartland. What do you think about this plan?
[2025-04-18 17:24:42.868]             From GERMANY: Hello, England. The situation on my end is stable, but France's growing power is indeed a concern. They currently have an army in KIE which is a direct threat to Berlin. I plan to try and dislodge them from KIE. I propose that you keep F NTH in a position that can support us against France and perhaps try to deny them access to the North Sea. Another option could be for you to make a move on F BRE or F GAS. Let's coordinate closely.
[2025-04-18 17:24:42.868]             From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance terms. Our main focus this round is to act against Turkey and possibly make a strategic move against Germany if an opportunity arises. Any actions in Scandinavia will be peaceful.

[2025-04-18 17:24:42.868]             From ENGLAND: Dear France, I agree that our joint plan against Germany should be reaffirmed. F ENG will support F BRE if it needs to hold position or move strategically such as to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean (MAO) if it makes sense for our alliance. However, I need to make sure that F ENG primarily holds the English Channel to prevent any unexpected moves. F NTH could indeed be used to support any strategic moves against Germany. Let us coordinate closely.
[2025-04-18 17:24:42.868]             From GERMANY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and mutual standoff in Belgium. However, your army in KIE is a direct threat to Berlin. It would be in the spirit of our non-aggression pact for you to move A KIE elsewhere such as to HOL or DEN if possible. This would help us maintain a peaceful border. Let us keep our agreement intact and focus on other threats such as England or Italy.
[2025-04-18 17:24:42.868]             From ITALY: Dear France, thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. Your suggestion for a joint action against Germany sounds interesting. However, A VIE might be needed for defense against potential threats from Austria or Russia. However, we are open to keeping an eye on Munich and will work together if the situation allows. Let us stay in touch.
[2025-04-18 17:24:42.868]             From RUSSIA: I acknowledge your proposal for a coordinated action against Germany. For now, our main focus is on Turkey and Austria, but I am open to a long-term alliance. A MOS could move to WAR if you make a coordinated move against Germany. However, we need a solid plan for such an action to make sure it does not leave us vulnerable elsewhere.

For now, my main focus is on Turkey. However, Italy does seem to be growing stronger and might be a concern for both of us. Let us keep our lines of communication open and be ready to support each other if Italy makes any aggressive moves against either of us.
[2025-04-18 17:24:42.868]             From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, I understand your concern regarding France's army in KIE. A coordinated action against France could indeed benefit us both. However, I need to make sure that any joint actions are well-coordinated and make strategic sense. I will consider supporting actions where F NTH can help, but I need a more specific plan. Let us keep in touch and make sure that our actions are well-coordinated.
[2025-04-18 17:24:42.868]             From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I appreciate our non-aggression pact and assure you that A KIE is primarily a defensive position against potential threats from England or Russia. However, if it makes you feel more secure, I could move A KIE to RUH while making sure our borders are secure. However, I need to keep a unit close to KIE for defense. Could you make any moves that support our mutual goal of securing our borders?
[2025-04-18 17:24:42.868]             From ITALY: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact still stands. A VIE and A TRI are primarily there for defense against any potential threats from other powers. There is no current intention to make any aggressive moves against you. Let us make sure our mutual agreement is respected.
[2025-04-18 17:24:42.868]             From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Our main focus is currently on Turkey and Austria. Any movements of A MOS would be primarily for actions against Turkey or Austria unless there is a clear opportunity elsewhere.

However, I am a bit concerned about your units in VIE and TRI which are close to my units in BUD and SER. Could you please provide a more specific plan for these units? I want to make sure that our non-aggression pact is respected and that we maintain open communication.
[2025-04-18 17:24:42.868]             From FRANCE: Hello, Italy. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I suggest that you focus on Austria and Turkey while I focus on Germany and England. For any support in the Mediterranean, I can keep F MAO in place to make sure our western Mediterranean remains secure and free of conflict. If you need any other support, let me know.
[2025-04-18 17:24:42.868]             From GERMANY: Hello, Italy. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. At the moment, I need to ensure that our borders remain secure. Do you have any specific plans for your units in VIE and TRI that could help us in mutual defense against Russia or Austria? It would be beneficial for us to keep our communication lines open and make sure there is no conflict in the Tyrolia region.
[2025-04-18 17:24:42.868]             From RUSSIA: I reaffirm the non-aggression pact until 1905. I am interested in a joint action against Turkey. F RUM could support any Italian moves from NAP to ION if Italy makes a move to support F RUM in case of a Turkish attack.
[2025-04-18 17:24:42.868]             From TURKEY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact.

Are you planning any moves against Austria that might require my support? For instance, any actions on BUD or GRE? Let us keep our lines of communication open.

I propose that I aim for Bulgaria next with A SER -> BUL (supported by F GRE if necessary) while you aim for Rumania. Your F RUM could support my A SER -> BUL if needed. I also agree that Italy seems to be growing stronger, so if Italy makes any aggressive moves, a joint action against Italy might be a good idea. However, for now, let us focus on Turkey until Italy makes a move against us.

[2025-04-18 17:24:42.869]             From ITALY: Dear Russia, our non-aggression pact stands. We are willing to make a coordinated action against Turkey where we make moves against Smyrna while you make moves against Bulgaria and Constantinople. However, a direct move against Smyrna might require us to make a fleet movement such as towards the Aegean Sea. A VIE might be used for a defensive position or a move against Austria if necessary. Let us make a detailed plan.

[2025-04-18 17:37:38.318]             From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Are there any threats from other powers such as Russia or Italy that we should be aware of? Let us continue our mutual support against any such threats.
[2025-04-18 17:37:38.318]             From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given that Turkey is a common threat, would you be interested in a joint action against them? Perhaps we could coordinate an attack on Bulgaria or Greece.
[2025-04-18 17:37:38.318]             From RUSSIA: Hello, it seems that no new center ownership changes occurred in the Spring 1903 Movement phase. What was the outcome of our joint action against Turkey? How should we proceed in the Fall 1903 round?

I suggest that you keep your fleets in NTH and ENG to keep pressure on Germany's northern flank. We need to make a coordinated effort to make sure that any German moves are countered effectively. What are your plans for the next round?
[2025-04-18 17:37:38.318]             From GERMANY: Dear England, it seems that France still holds KIE. I propose that we continue our joint plan against France. Could you use your fleets in NTH and SKA to support Germany in retaking KIE or to put pressure on France's other units such as F BRE or F GAS? Let us coordinate our actions.

[2025-04-18 17:37:38.318]             From GERMANY: Dear France, I see that you currently hold KIE, which is a home supply center for Germany. I would like to propose that you move your unit out of KIE so that Germany can retake it. We have a non-aggression pact and should focus on other regions such as England or Italy. What are your thoughts on this?
[2025-04-18 17:37:38.318]             From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given that we both have interests in the Mediterranean, is there any way we can cooperate further? Perhaps a joint action against Austria could be beneficial for us both.

If you need any support against France, I could potentially assist you. However, it is crucial that we make sure that our borders remain peaceful and that our pact is still in place.
[2025-04-18 17:37:38.318]             From ENGLAND: I understand your concerns about France's army in KIE. If you have a well-coordinated plan against France, I am willing to consider joint actions. However, our main goal should be to make sure that France does not gain too much power.
[2025-04-18 17:37:38.318]             From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact and mutual standoff in Belgium. Any aggressive moves might provoke a strong response from us and our allies. Let us maintain peace and focus on other threats.
[2025-04-18 17:37:38.318]             From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I hope that our units can continue to respect each other's borders and interests. Let us keep the peace in central Europe.

However, your units in Vienna and Trieste are close to my units in Budapest and Serbia. Could you please reassure me that you intend to maintain our non-aggression pact and that these units are not a threat to me? We need to make sure that our pact is still in place and that our borders remain peaceful.
[2025-04-18 17:37:38.318]             From ENGLAND: Hello, Italy. I would like to understand your current intentions and see if there is any potential for us to work together. What are your main goals for the next round?
[2025-04-18 17:37:38.318]             From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. It makes sense for us to keep peace in the Western Mediterranean while you focus on Austria or Turkey. What are your plans for the next round?
[2025-04-18 17:37:38.318]             From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I hope that you do not make any moves towards Germany's territories such as Munich or Tyrolia. Let us focus on our immediate neighbors such as France and Austria.

I am reaffirming our non-aggression pact where we agreed that you focus on the Western Mediterranean while I focus on the Black Sea and Armenia. However, now that Austria only holds BUD, GRE, and SER, I would like to propose a joint action where we might divide Austria's remaining centers. I plan to make a move on Serbia or Greece.

I aim to make a move on Bulgaria while you should aim for Constantinople or Ankara. Could you support my move A SER -> BUL with your F RUM? Additionally, could you clarify your intentions for A UKR? Our plan was that you would not make moves towards Galicia. Let us continue our cooperation to ensure that Turkey is effectively countered.

I suggest we continue our coordinated attacks on Austria's remaining centers. I plan to make a move on Serbia or Greece this round.

[2025-04-18 17:44:08.592]             From GERMANY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact and offering support against France. I believe a joint action against France could be beneficial. However, it might make sense for you to focus on Italy and make sure they do not make a move against you. I will handle the northern front against France. If you need any support against Italy, we could discuss it further.
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.592]             From ITALY: Hello Austria, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. The units in Vienna and Trieste are indeed for defensive purposes, and I intend to keep our borders peaceful. However, Turkey seems to be eyeing your centers in Serbia and Greece. I suggest that you focus on defending against potential Turkish threats while we maintain our pact. Let us make sure that our borders remain secure and peaceful.
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.592]             From RUSSIA: Thank you for your message. I plan to support your A BUD -> BUL with my A UKR and F RUM can hold or support another strategic move. However, it seems that Italy has captured Vienna which makes them a new threat. We might need to adjust our plans accordingly. What are your thoughts on a joint action against Italy?

[2025-04-18 17:44:08.592]             From FRANCE: Thank you for your continued support. It would be helpful if F ENG could support any potential moves such as A BUR to RUH or A HOL to RUH if necessary. Let us keep up the pressure on Germany together.
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.592]             From GERMANY: I am glad to see you are open to a joint action against France. To make a coordinated attack, I suggest that your fleet in the North Sea could support my fleet in Sweden if France makes a move, while I could support your actions in the English Channel if you move against France's fleets. Another option could be for your fleet in the North Sea to move to the Baltic Sea where it can help us secure the north against any potential Russian moves while we focus on KIE and possibly Belgium. What do you think?
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.593]             From ITALY: Hello England, my main goal for the next round is to secure the Mediterranean and make strategic moves against Austria and Turkey. I am open to any potential cooperation that aligns with this goal. What are your current intentions and how do you see us working together?
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.593]             From RUSSIA: The Northern Triple alliance remains important. To support against Germany and France, I need to make sure that my southern front is secure. Once that is in place, I can make more aggressive moves against Germany's eastern front. For now, I plan to keep A STP and A MOS ready to make a move if necessary.

[2025-04-18 17:44:08.593]             From ENGLAND: Dear ally, thank you for your message. I plan to keep my fleets in NTH and ENG to keep pressure on Germany's northern flank. Let us make sure we coordinate effectively. I am open to any specific suggestions you have for a joint action. What should be our key targets for Fall 1903?
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.593]             From GERMANY: I also want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact and mutual standoff in Belgium. However, I am concerned about your unit in KIE, which is close to my capital in Berlin. To maintain our non-aggression pact, I suggest that you focus on other regions such as Italy or England while I handle my eastern borders. Could you please make a move away from KIE or make a clear statement about your intentions there?
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.593]             From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I agree that it makes sense for us to keep peace in the Western Mediterranean while I focus on Austria or Turkey. My plans for the next round include making strategic moves against Austria and Turkey. I hope that we can continue our peaceful relations in the Western Mediterranean.
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.593]             From RUSSIA: I appreciate your proposal for a coordinated action against Germany. I plan to put pressure on Germany's eastern front while you attack from the West. A MOS could move towards WAR if that makes sense strategically. Let us keep in touch for any further coordination.

[2025-04-18 17:44:08.593]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Currently, Italy has units in VIE and TRI close to BUD and SER, which could be a potential threat despite our non-aggression pact until 1905. Additionally, Russia has a unit in UKR which could threaten BUD if our alliance breaks down. Therefore, mutual support against any aggressive moves by Italy or Russia would be appreciated. How do you plan to handle the French threat near your borders?
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.594]             From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, I understand your need to retake Kiel. I will consider using my fleet in NTH and SKA to support actions against France's units such as F BRE or F GAS. However, we need a well-coordinated plan. What specific moves do you suggest for us to make a joint effort against France?
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.594]             From FRANCE: I understand your request for Kiel. However, holding Kiel is important for our strategic position. Perhaps we could negotiate a temporary withdrawal if you agree to a joint action against England or Italy. What are your thoughts on a joint action against England?
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.594]             From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure you that I have no intention to make any moves towards your territories such as Munich or Tyrolia. My current focus is on my immediate neighbors such as Austria and Turkey. I hope that we can keep our borders peaceful.
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.594]             From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and will not make moves towards your territories such as Sweden or Berlin. Let us respect our borders and focus on our respective goals.

[2025-04-18 17:44:08.594]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. A joint action against Turkey makes sense. I propose that your fleet in ADR could support my move from A SER to BUL (A SER -> BUL supported by F ADR), while my fleet in GRE moves to the Aegean Sea (F GRE -> AEG) to threaten Smyrna or Constantinople. I believe this plan could help us make significant gains against Turkey this fall. However, please make sure that any troop movements are purely defensive unless a mutual action against Turkey is decided upon.
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.594]             From FRANCE: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A joint action against Austria could be beneficial. However, we need to make sure that any such action does not weaken our main focus on Germany. How do you propose we coordinate against Austria?
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.594]             From GERMANY: I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. We should make sure that our borders remain peaceful. I hope that we can continue to respect each other’s interests and keep the peace in central Europe.
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.594]             From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and am interested in a joint action against Turkey. I could use your support in moving into Bulgaria or Constantinople while I can support your movements into Serbia or Greece. However, I need to make sure that our actions are well-coordinated.
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.594]             From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I am indeed interested in joint actions against Austria. Given that you have units in VIE and TRI, could you make a move on BUD while I aim for SER or GRE? A coordinated attack could help us both gain a supply center from Austria.

[2025-04-18 17:44:08.594]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, The joint action against Turkey seems to be making progress. For Fall 1903, I propose that A SER should move to Bulgaria supported by F RUM if possible (A SER -> BUL, F RUM supports A SER -> BUL), while F GRE should move to the Aegean Sea (F GRE -> AEG) to make a future attack on Smyrna or Constantinople. What are your plans for A UKR and F RUM in the Fall round? It is crucial that we maintain our cooperation.
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.594]             From ENGLAND: Hello, the Northern Triple alliance seems to be holding up well. For Fall 1903, we need to make sure that we keep the pressure on France and Germany where it makes sense. What specific actions do you suggest for us to make a coordinated move against Germany or France?
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.594]             From FRANCE: The coordinated action against Germany is progressing well. For Fall 1903, I suggest that you put pressure on Germany from the east while we attack from the west. Any support you can provide in that direction would be greatly appreciated.
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.595]             From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Let us focus on our other fronts such as England for you and France for me. How about we make sure that our units do not make any aggressive moves against each other?
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.595]             From ITALY: Hello Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. The joint action against Turkey has been successful so far, with us holding strong positions. For Fall 1903, I suggest that we continue to put pressure on Turkey. Perhaps we can make a plan where your fleet in RUM supports my efforts in the Black Sea, and we try to make a move on Bulgaria or Constantinople. What do you think?
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.595]             From TURKEY: Hello Russia, indeed, no new center ownership changes occurred in the Spring 1903 Movement phase. For Fall 1903, I plan to move A BUL to SER (supported by A CON) and F BLA to AEG (for a potential move on GRE). I would appreciate if you could support A BUL to SER with F RUM and make a move on BUD if possible. Let us continue our Juggernaut alliance against Austria.

[2025-04-18 17:44:08.595]             From ITALY: Hello Turkey, thank you for your congratulations on capturing Vienna. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact where you focus on the Black Sea and Armenia while I focus on the Western Mediterranean. I am open to a joint action to divide Austria’s remaining centers. I plan to make a move on Budapest while you make a move on Serbia and Greece. Is that a plan you would agree to? However, we need to make sure that our actions are coordinated so that we do not conflict.
[2025-04-18 17:44:08.595]             From RUSSIA: Our Juggernaut alliance has indeed been successful. I plan to support your A BUL -> SER if another round of movement is needed. My F RUM can support this move. However, we need to make sure that Italy does not become a new threat in the region. What are your thoughts on Italy's recent capture of Vienna?

This would allow you to focus on the Balkans while I focus on Northern Europe.
[2025-04-18 17:56:45.109]             From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Make sure that you do not make any aggressive moves against Germany. I propose that you focus on France and Austria while I focus on Russia and England.
[2025-04-18 17:56:45.109]             From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905 and plan a joint action against Turkey. I suggest that you support moves into Bulgaria or Constantinople while I support you in Serbia or Greece. What are your thoughts on this plan for the Fall 1903 movement phase?
[2025-04-18 17:56:45.109]             From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. It seems that Austria is on the brink of elimination. How do you plan to proceed against Austria's remaining centers (BUD, GRE, SER)? I am planning to make a move on Serbia. Can we make sure that our actions are coordinated so that we do not conflict?

[2025-04-18 17:56:45.109]             From AUSTRIA: It seems that our joint action against Turkey has been effective so far. To keep the momentum, let us make sure that F RUM supports A SER -> BUL this turn. I plan to move F GRE to AEG if that makes sense for us. What is your plan for A UKR and F RUM?
[2025-04-18 17:56:45.109]             From ENGLAND: Russia, our Northern Triple alliance seems to be holding, and I plan to make a move on Sweden. Could you make a move on Germany or support us in any way?
[2025-04-18 17:56:45.109]             From FRANCE: Dear Russia, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I propose a coordinated action against Germany or Turkey. If you make a move against Germany's A WAR or against Turkey's A BUL, it could help us both make strategic gains.

[2025-04-18 17:56:45.109]             From ITALY: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given your units in RUM and UKR, a joint action against either Austria or Turkey could be beneficial. What are your thoughts on a coordinated attack on Turkey?
[2025-04-18 17:56:45.109]             From TURKEY: Dear Russia, let us continue our Juggernaut alliance. I propose that we make a coordinated attack on Austria's remaining centers. I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. Could you support this move with F RUM? Another option is for my F BLA to move to AEG to threaten Greece. What are your thoughts on this plan?

[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From GERMANY: Thank you for reaffirming the non-aggression pact. France indeed seems to be a growing power and a potential threat to both of us. We need to keep a close watch on France's moves. An alliance against France could be beneficial for both of us. Any moves you make against France would be appreciated. However, I need to make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves against us either. How do you suggest we proceed?
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From ITALY: I confirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Units in VIE and TRI will not make aggressive moves against BUD or SER. Our main focus should indeed be on countering Turkey. How can we coordinate our actions against Turkey? Perhaps you could hold BUD and SER while I support you from VIE and TRI if Turkey makes a move.
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that our joint action against Turkey has been effective. I plan to support A SER -> BUL with F RUM. A UKR could also support A BUD -> BUL if that makes sense for us. What specific plans do you have for the next moves against Turkey?

[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From FRANCE: Our alliance against Germany is indeed working well. For Fall 1903, I plan to make a move on BUR with A PAR. Could F ENG support F BRE to hold its position or make a move to the English Channel if necessary? Additionally, I suggest that F SKA should make a move on Sweden (F SKA to SWE) while F NTH supports F SKA to SWE if necessary. A HOL could support any potential English moves into Belgium if needed.
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From GERMANY: I agree that France is becoming a dominant power in Western Europe. A temporary truce or coordination against France makes sense. However, I need to keep control of Sweden (F SWE). If you need to make a move on Sweden, it could jeopardize our potential alliance against France. Perhaps we should find another way for you to expand your power. How about focusing on Belgium or Holland instead? Your fleet could support my A BUR move to Holland and we could work together against France.
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From RUSSIA: Dear England, the Northern Triple alliance is holding well. I plan to make sure that A STP supports any moves you make against Germany's F SWE. Let us keep coordinating against Germany and France.

[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From ENGLAND: Dear France, we need a well-coordinated plan for the English Channel. Moving F ENG to NTH is not feasible as F NTH already occupies that sea. Moving F ENG to SKA would make us vulnerable in the English Channel. A possible alternative could be moving F ENG to IRISH SEA if you need access to ENG for a specific plan. However, another part of your message mentions a joint plan if Germany vacates Belgium. However, Belgium is currently under your control, so could you clarify what you mean? Let us make a plan where both of us gain strategic advantages against Germany.
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From GERMANY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. I agree that maintaining a peaceful border is important. However, I have concerns about your unit in Holland (A HOL) being so close to my unit in Burgundy (A BUR). I hope that you make no aggressive moves against KIE or BER. Let us focus on our respective goals while keeping our borders peaceful.
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From ITALY: I confirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I am open to a cooperative stance in the Mediterranean. However, my main focus is on the Balkans and Turkey. Any action against Austria should be well-coordinated so that I can secure some of Austria's remaining centers such as BUD, GRE, or SER. However, I am primarily focused on countering Turkey.
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From RUSSIA: Dear France, I agree that a coordinated action against Germany could be beneficial. I plan to make a move against Germany's A WAR with A MOS if you make a coordinated move against Germany. Let us keep in touch.

[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and agree that we need to be vigilant against any aggressive moves from Italy or Russia. For now, our main focus is on the joint action against Turkey to gain supply centers such as Bulgaria. Let us keep an eye on Italy's units near BUD and SER. If Italy makes any aggressive moves, we should be ready to support each other.
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, we understand your concerns about a strong France. However, our F ENG is currently positioned strategically in the English Channel to protect our interests. Supporting your F SWE to hold might not be feasible unless we make a well-defined plan where both of us make equal gains. Could you provide a more specific plan where both of us make significant gains against France?
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding as I do not have a unit in KIE. I agree that a strong France should not be a threat to us both. I propose that you focus on Russia and Austria while I focus on England and Italy. To make a non-aggressive move, could A BUR move to RUH or support another German unit elsewhere? This would help us both focus on our common threats.
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From ITALY: I confirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I will not make any aggressive moves against Germany. My main focus is on the Balkans and the Mediterranean, so any action against France might be a secondary priority. However, I am open to keeping Germany as an ally until Austria and Turkey are dealt with.
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A STP does not plan to move against SWE. My main focus is on Turkey and Austria. I suggest that you focus on France and England while I focus on Turkey and Austria.

[2025-04-18 18:03:14.234]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Our main focus is on the Balkans and Turkey such that troop movements should be seen as part of a defensive plan unless a mutual action against another power is decided. Please make sure that your units in VIE and TRI do not make any threatening moves towards BUD or SER. We need to trust each other for mutual support if another power makes an aggressive move.
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.235]             From FRANCE: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given our strong position, I am interested in coordinating actions against Germany. I plan to make a move on BUR with A PAR. Could you make a move against Austria such as A VIE to BUD or A TRI to BUD? Additionally, any cooperation in the Mediterranean should be focused on containing Turkey.
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.235]             From GERMANY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. It is important for us to make sure that our strategic positioning does not cause any misunderstandings. At the moment, France appears to be a growing power and a potential threat. Any support you can provide by making moves against France could be mutually beneficial. What are your thoughts?
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.235]             From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A joint action against Turkey makes sense. A UKR could support any moves you make against Turkey such as A VEN -> BUL. What are your specific plans for this round?
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.235]             From TURKEY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. For the next round, I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON and A UKR (if Russia agrees). F BLA will move to AEG to prepare for a potential move on GRE. It would be helpful if you could focus on BUD or support us in taking SER or GRE if possible. What are your thoughts on this plan?

[2025-04-18 18:03:14.235]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, I agree to continue our joint action against Turkey. However, instead of moving A BUD to BUL with support from A UKR, I suggest that A SER moves to BUL with support from F RUM while A BUD holds. This plan makes more sense as it keeps BUD defended while making a move on BUL. Additionally, I plan to move F GRE to AEG so that it can be used either to attack Smyrna or support any future action on Constantinople. What do you think of this plan?
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.235]             From ENGLAND: Dear Russia, we reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance and agree to make no aggressive moves towards your A STP from our F SKA. It's important that our mutual interests in Scandinavia are respected. Do you have any plans for a coordinated action against Germany or France this round?
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.235]             From FRANCE: Let us continue our long-term alliance where I focus on Germany while you focus on Austria and Turkey. I support your plan for A MOS to move to WAR. I plan to make a coordinated move such as A PAR to BUR. Additionally, I suggest that F RUM should make a move against Turkey such as F RUM to BLA.
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.235]             From GERMANY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. I agree that making no aggressive moves between A WAR and A MOS makes sense. I hope that you make no aggressive moves against F SWE as well. Let us keep our borders peaceful and focus on our respective goals.
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.235]             From ITALY: I confirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I agree to a joint action against Turkey. I could aim for Bulgaria or Constantinople while you support me in Serbia or Greece. Let us make a plan for the Fall 1903 movement phase where I move into Bulgaria and you support me from RUM.
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.235]             From TURKEY: Thank you for reaffirming our Juggernaut alliance. I agree that A BUL should move to SER supported by A UKR and A CON. F RUM could hold or support another action such as defending against any potential counter-attacks. F BLA will move to AEG to prepare for a potential move on GRE. What do you think about this plan?

[2025-04-18 18:03:14.235]             From ITALY: I confirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. It seems that Austria is indeed on the brink of elimination. I plan to make a move on BUD while you make a move on Serbia. Let us make sure that our actions are well-coordinated so that we do not conflict and can effectively eliminate Austria.
[2025-04-18 18:03:14.235]             From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, let us continue our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. I agree that A BUL -> SER supported by A CON makes sense, and F RUM will support A BUL -> SER. Another option for F BLA to move to AEG to threaten Greece also seems reasonable. A UKR could support A BUL -> BUD if needed. Let us keep coordinating.

[2025-04-18 18:15:38.577]             From FRANCE: I hope our non-aggression pact still holds. It makes sense for both of us to keep a mutual standoff in Belgium and Burgundy. Do you agree?
[2025-04-18 18:15:38.577]             From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. How can we further strengthen our alliance? Would you be interested in any joint actions against France or Russia?
[2025-04-18 18:15:38.577]             From RUSSIA: GERMANY, our non-aggression pact has been important for us both. Do you plan to keep F SWE where it is? I need to make plans for the next year.

[2025-04-18 18:15:38.577]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. However, I need reassurance about the intentions for your units in TRI and BOH. Could you please clarify your plans for these units? Additionally, I suggest that we continue our joint action against Turkey where you could support our efforts in the Balkans or help in capturing Constantinople or Smyrna. What are your thoughts on this?
[2025-04-18 18:15:38.577]             From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I see that you have a significant military presence and six supply centers. What are your intentions for the next year? Is there potential for us to cooperate against France or Germany?
[2025-04-18 18:15:38.577]             From FRANCE: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 is still important. I see that you have a strong position in the Balkans. Perhaps we could cooperate against Austria or Turkey if that aligns with your plans.
[2025-04-18 18:15:38.577]             From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. I am concerned about your unit in A TYR which could potentially threaten MUN. I request that you do not make a move on MUN and instead focus on other regions such as Austria or Turkey. Let us maintain our peaceful relations.
[2025-04-18 18:15:38.577]             From RUSSIA: ITALY, I see that you have units in TRI and ALB. What are your intentions in the Balkans? Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and continue our joint action against Turkey. What is your plan for the next moves against Turkey?
[2025-04-18 18:15:38.577]             From TURKEY: The situation with Austria is still precarious for them. What are your plans for Austria's remaining centers such as BUD and GRE? I aim to focus on SER and GRE. It would make sense for us to coordinate so that you aim for BUD while I aim for SER and GRE. Do you agree with this plan for the next round? We need to make sure that our non-aggression pact holds firm.

[2025-04-18 18:15:38.578]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, our joint action against Turkey seems to be progressing well. I now hold BUL and Turkey has a dislodged unit in BUL that needs to retreat or disband. What should be our next steps? I suggest that we aim to capture Constantinople or Ankara. What are your plans for A UKR and F RUM in the next round?
[2025-04-18 18:15:38.578]             From ENGLAND: Dear Russia, our Northern Triple alliance has been beneficial so far. What are your plans for the next year? How can we coordinate actions against Germany or France? Let us make sure our alliance remains strong.
[2025-04-18 18:15:38.578]             From FRANCE: Our alliance should continue. I propose a joint action against Germany or Turkey. What is your current strategy and how can we support each other?
[2025-04-18 18:15:38.578]             From GERMANY: Dear Russia, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. I want to make sure that you do not make a move on SWE. I propose that you focus on the south against Turkey while I handle the threat from France. Let us respect our borders and maintain our peaceful relations.
[2025-04-18 18:15:38.578]             From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given the current situation, a joint action against Turkey seems beneficial. What are your thoughts on this?
[2025-04-18 18:15:38.578]             From TURKEY: Our attempt to capture BUD and SER didn't succeed this round. However, Austria is weakened with only three centers remaining. Let us continue our Juggernaut alliance. For the next round, I propose that you focus on BUD while I aim for SER and GRE. For the dislodged unit in BUL, I need to retreat it to either RUM or GRE. Would you allow A BUL to retreat to RUM if that makes strategic sense for us? Another option might be to disband the unit if a strategic retreat seems unlikely to be beneficial. What is your opinion?

[2025-04-18 18:15:38.578]             From RUSSIA: TURKEY, I see that your A BUL was dislodged. I recommend retreating it to CON if that's the only valid retreat option. Let us continue our alliance against Austria. A UKR can support any move you need against Austria or Italy in the coming turns. What is your plan?

[2025-04-18 18:21:45.325]             From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I believe mutual support against France and Russia would be beneficial. France currently holds KIE and has a unit in Holland, which is a concern for me. Additionally, Russia's presence in the Baltic region could be a threat to us both.

Perhaps you could make a move on SER and GRE while I aim for BUD. Let us keep the communication open.

[2025-04-18 18:21:45.326]             From FRANCE: Dear England, our alliance against Germany is indeed working well. For Winter 1903, there should be no need for any builds or disbands as no centers changed ownership. For Spring 1904, I plan to move A PAR to BUR (if Germany agrees to move A BUR elsewhere), F BRE to ENG (with support from F NTH if possible), and F SPA/NC could support F BRE to ENG or move to MAO. A HOL could stay in place or move to BEL if that makes strategic sense. How can we best coordinate our moves against Germany? Perhaps F NTH could support F BRE to ENG.
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.326]             From GERMANY: Dear England, I am glad to hear that you are open to a well-coordinated plan against France. I aim to retake KIE and possibly make a move towards Holland. If you could make a significant push in the North Sea or the English Channel, it would put pressure on France from multiple fronts. Let us discuss a more specific plan where both of us make significant gains against France.
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.326]             From ITALY: Dear England, thank you for your message. I am open to future cooperation where our interests align. For now, my main focus is on the Balkans and the Mediterranean. However, if there is a strategic opportunity for us to cooperate against France or Germany in the future, I am open to discussing that as well.
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.326]             From RUSSIA: Dear England, I reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. Currently, my main focus is on securing the southern front against Turkey. Once that situation is resolved, a coordinated action against Germany could be considered where you make a move from the north while I make a move from the east. Let us make sure our alliance remains strong.

[2025-04-18 18:21:45.326]             From ENGLAND: Our joint plan against Germany seems to be making good progress. I suggest that we continue our coordinated actions. For the next round, I propose that F ENG could support F BRE if necessary, while F NTH could support any potential French moves into the North Sea or against German units. A YOR could be used to support any land-based actions against Germany if necessary. What specific targets do you have in mind for a joint attack on Germany?
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.326]             From GERMANY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and agree on a mutual standoff in Belgium and Burgundy. However, I am concerned about your unit in Holland (A HOL) and your control of KIE. It makes sense for us to keep a stable border, but I need a clear understanding of your intentions in the region. Can we agree that you will not make any aggressive moves towards my territories such as Munich or Berlin?
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.326]             From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My main focus is currently on Turkey. However, I would be open to a joint action against Austria if you make a specific proposal. Let us keep in touch.
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.326]             From RUSSIA: Dear France, I acknowledge your proposal for a joint action against Germany or Turkey. My current strategy is to focus on Turkey until the situation in the south is resolved. Once Turkey is sufficiently weakened, a joint action against Germany could be a viable plan where you attack from the west while I make a move from the east. Let us keep in touch and support each other.

[2025-04-18 18:21:45.326]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given the current situation, I agree that it makes sense for us to work together against any threats from Italy or Russia. However, our main focus should still be on neutralizing Turkey first. Once that is done, we can better address any threats from Italy or Russia. Let us keep in close communication.
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.326]             From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact still stands. I understand your concerns about F SKA potentially threatening SWE. However, my main focus is on France's units such as F BRE and F SPA/NC. A joint action against France could indeed be beneficial for both of us. However, I need a more specific plan where both parties make significant gains against France. What specific moves do you propose?
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.326]             From FRANCE: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact still stands. I understand your concerns about A HOL and KIE. I can move A HOL to BEL if that makes you feel more secure. However, vacating KIE is a significant strategic decision. I would be willing to make a concession on KIE if you make a significant concession such as moving A BUR to RUH or another non-threatening position. Let us focus on our respective goals and avoid any conflicts.
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.326]             From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. The unit in TYR is primarily for defensive purposes and not intended to threaten MUN. However, any aggressive moves from Germany would be met with a firm response. Let us maintain our peaceful relations.
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.327]             From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure you that I have no plans to make a move on SWE. My current focus is on the south against Turkey. Once that situation is resolved, a joint action against France could be considered where you handle the threat from France while I make a move from the east if necessary. Let us respect our borders and maintain our peaceful relations.

It seems that Turkey is a mutual threat. I suggest that your F ION could support my F AEG for a potential move to Smyrna or support an attack on Constantinople. Let us work together to eliminate the Turkish threat.

However, it is important that we make sure our actions are well-coordinated. I plan to make a move such as A PAR to BUR. Could you make a move such as A BOH to MUN to put pressure on Germany from the south? However, make sure that our non-aggression pact remains intact.
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.327]             From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. To strengthen our alliance, I am interested in joint actions against France or Russia.

[2025-04-18 18:21:45.327]             From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and am willing to consider a joint action against Turkey. I propose that you aim for Greece and Serbia while I aim for Constantinople and Ankara. Once Turkey is sufficiently weakened, a joint action against Austria could be considered where you make a move from the west while I make a move from the east. Let us make sure our cooperation is fruitful.
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.327]             From TURKEY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact as well. I am open to joint action against Austria. My A BUL was dislodged and will likely retreat to GRE. I plan to make moves towards capturing GRE and possibly SER next round. Meanwhile, could you aim for BUD to divide Austria's remaining centers between us?

[2025-04-18 18:21:45.327]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, thank you for your support in capturing Bulgaria. Our joint action against Turkey is indeed progressing well. However, GRE and SER are already under my control. I suggest that our next targets should be Constantinople and Smyrna. I propose that you aim for Constantinople while I aim for Smyrna. My F AEG could move to Smyrna if supported by F ION. Let us continue our cooperation until Turkey is fully neutralized.
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.327]             From ENGLAND: Russia, our Northern Triple alliance has been very useful for us both. For the next year, I plan to continue our coordinated actions against Germany. I need your support in the north such as A STP making a move against Sweden or supporting any of our moves in the north. Additionally, A MOS could make a move against Germany's A WAR or support any other actions against Germany. What are your thoughts on this plan?
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.327]             From FRANCE: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our long-term alliance where I focus on Germany while you focus on Austria and Turkey. The front against Germany is progressing well. Any additional pressure from you on Germany's eastern front would be beneficial. Perhaps a move such as A MOS to WAR could put pressure on Germany's A WAR unit. Let us continue to coordinate closely.
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.327]             From GERMANY: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I plan to keep F SWE where it is unless there is a need for a strategic move. However, any aggressive moves by you towards Sweden will be met with resistance. Let us keep our borders stable and focus on our respective goals.
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.327]             From ITALY: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I am keen on continuing our joint action against Turkey. What specific plans do you have for us to collaborate against Turkey?
[2025-04-18 18:21:45.327]             From TURKEY: Thank you for your advice. However, A CON is already in CON, so my A BUL will likely need to retreat to GRE if that is a valid option. Let us continue our alliance against Austria. I plan to make moves towards capturing GRE and SER. Your A UKR could support any move you need against Austria or Italy in the coming turns. What is your plan?

[2025-04-18 18:21:45.327]             From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, I acknowledge that our attempt to capture BUD and SER didn't succeed and that Austria is weakened. I agree that the Juggernaut alliance should continue. A BUL should retreat to GRE if possible, as RUM is currently occupied by my F RUM. For the next round, I could support a Turkish move into SER while you make a move into GRE. Let us make a strategic retreat and plan our next moves carefully.

[2025-04-18 18:46:08.619]             From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. Given the current situation, working together against Turkey seems beneficial. If you move A BUD to SER and I support you with F ALB, we could retake Greece. Meanwhile, I could also make a move on Smyrna via F ION -> AEG -> SMY. What do you think?
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.619]             From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, congratulations on your recent gains against Turkey. I would like to reaffirm our joint action against Turkey. It seems that Turkey is now weaker, but we need to make sure they don't recover. Additionally, what are your thoughts on Italy's growing presence in the Balkans? Perhaps a coordinated action could be beneficial for our mutual interests.

[2025-04-18 18:46:08.620]             From FRANCE: Dear England, let us reaffirm our joint plan against Germany. I propose that you use F ENG and F NTH to support my F BRE into ENG so that we can jointly control the English Channel. Additionally, it would be great if you make a move with F SKA to support an attack on SWE (currently held by Germany). Together, we can put significant pressure on Germany.
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.620]             From GERMANY: Dear England, as previously discussed, a joint plan against France seems beneficial for both of us. How should we coordinate our fleets in the North Sea and Baltic against France? Perhaps you could move F Ska to support F SWE, while I make sure that A BUR keeps pressure on French borders.
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.620]             From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. Once the situation with Turkey is stabilized, I am open to future cooperation against major powers like France or Germany.
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.620]             From RUSSIA: Dear England, the Northern Triple alliance has been beneficial for us so far. Given France's growing power, what are your plans for F NTH and F ENG? It might be in our mutual interest to make sure that France does not become too dominant.

[2025-04-18 18:46:08.620]             From ENGLAND: Dear France, our alliance has been fruitful thus far, and I am glad to see that our joint actions against Germany have been successful. However, your power has grown significantly. To maintain a balance, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact, specifically for the English Channel. What are your thoughts on continuing our joint focus on Germany? However, I would like to make sure that your growing strength does not bring any aggressive intentions towards me.
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.620]             From GERMANY: Dear France, it is important that our non-aggression pact remains intact. However, I need clarification on your intentions regarding the unit in A HOL and the supply center KIE. Could you assure me that you are not planning any aggressive moves against Germany? We need to make sure that our borders remain secure so that we can focus on our respective goals.
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.620]             From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. My main focus is currently on Turkey. However, if you have any specific proposals against another power (such as Austria or Germany), I am open to discussing them.
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.620]             From RUSSIA: Dear France, your expansion and current power are impressive. I want to reaffirm our long-term alliance where you focus on Germany while I focus on the south. However, any aggressive moves should be well-coordinated so that no single power becomes too dominant. What are your plans for the coming moves?

[2025-04-18 18:46:08.620]             From AUSTRIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. France now controls 9 supply centers and seems to be a significant threat. Should we consider a joint action against France? Your thoughts on the situation would be appreciated.
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.621]             From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, it appears that France has grown very strong and now poses a significant threat to both of us. I would like to propose a new alliance where we make a concerted effort against France. What do you think about a plan where we jointly target France's units and supply centers such as BUR, PAR, or BEL? We need to act swiftly to curb France's expansion.
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.621]             From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I hope to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. It would be in our best interest to keep a mutual standoff in Belgium where my A HOL should not be threatened. Any aggressive moves from your part might force a response from us, which we both want to avoid.
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.621]             From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. A TYR is still here for defensive purposes only.
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.621]             From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I hope you are well. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I need to understand your intentions for the unit in Sweden. Are you planning any aggressive moves in the north? It would be beneficial for us to continue our peaceful relations and perhaps even cooperate against any emerging threats such as France.

[2025-04-18 18:46:08.621]             From AUSTRIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I need reassurance regarding your A TRI and A TYR units close to my centers. Should we also consider a joint action against Turkey or perhaps a new threat, such as France, who now has 9 supply centers?
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.621]             From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, France has grown very strong and now holds 8 supply centers. This makes them a significant threat to all of us. I am interested in forming an alliance with you to curb France's expansion. What are your thoughts on this? How can we collaborate to make a concerted effort against France?
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.621]             From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I wish to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. While I focus on Germany, I suggest that you make a move against Austria or Turkey. This could help us both to expand our influence while keeping our borders peaceful.
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.621]             From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I want to make sure that our non-aggression pact stands strong. However, I need to verify your intentions regarding A TYR which borders A MUN. Can you assure me that you are not planning any aggressive moves against Munich?
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.621]             From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Given Turkey's weakened state, what are your plans in the Balkans? Perhaps a joint action against Turkey could be mutually beneficial.

[2025-04-18 18:46:08.621]             From AUSTRIA: We should continue our joint action against Turkey. I propose that your F RUM supports my A BUL to hold against any potential Turkish attacks. Alternatively, you could support my F AEG to move to Constantinople if you make a move from the Black Sea. How does that sound?
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.622]             From ENGLAND: Dear Russia, I hope our Northern Triple alliance is still strong. Given that France has grown significantly, I believe it would be in our mutual interest to make a coordinated effort against France if necessary. What are your thoughts on this? How can we collaborate further to ensure a balanced power distribution on the board?
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.622]             From FRANCE: Dear Russia, I hope to reaffirm our non-aggression pact and propose a coordinated action against Germany. It would be ideal if you make a move from A MOS to attack WAR while I plan a move such as A PAR to BUR. This way, we can put pressure on Germany from multiple fronts.
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.622]             From GERMANY: Dear Russia, it is important that we reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I need to make sure that any potential moves in the Baltic Sea are clearly communicated so that there are no misunderstandings between us.
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.622]             From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. Given Turkey's strong position, a joint action might be necessary. I plan to support Austria in retaking Greece while making a move on Smyrna. Can you support us from the north with F RUM -> BLA and A UKR -> SEV?

To keep our pact valid, what can we do to ensure that our interests do not clash? Perhaps a more defined border could help us avoid any misunderstandings.
[2025-04-18 18:46:08.622]             From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, despite recent setbacks, I want to reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. It's crucial that we plan a coordinated counter-attack to retake Bulgaria. What are your plans for the coming moves?

[2025-04-18 18:53:38.906]             From GERMANY: I agree that France has grown very strong and poses a significant threat to us both. A joint action against France makes sense. However, we need to make sure Russia does not take advantage of our focus on France. Can you provide support against Russia while I focus on the western front? A coordinated attack on France could include us both making moves that put pressure on their supply centers such as BEL, PAR, and HOL.
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.906]             From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My units A TRI and A TYR are primarily for defensive purposes and to help us both secure our borders against other potential aggressors. However, I agree that a joint action against Turkey could be mutually beneficial. What specific plans do you have in mind for this year? Perhaps I could support you in retaking Greece while making a move on Smyrna.
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.906]             From RUSSIA: I agree to support your A BUL hold with my F RUM. Additionally, my A UKR could support any strategic move you make from BUD to BUL or another location if needed. Let's keep pressuring Turkey together.

[2025-04-18 18:53:38.906]             From FRANCE: Dear England, I am glad that our alliance has been fruitful thus far. I also want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact specifically for the English Channel. My intentions are not aggressive towards you; instead, I want to continue our joint focus on Germany until they are sufficiently weakened. Let us make sure that the English Channel remains a peaceful zone unless we both agree upon a joint action. What are your thoughts?
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.906]             From GERMANY: I agree that France poses a significant threat to our interests. I propose a coordinated plan where I could move A BUR to RUH (if not directly attacking) and potentially support any moves you make against French units such as F BRE or A HOL. Additionally, I need your support for a potential move to KIE if that supply center is still in question. Let us continue our cooperation to curb France's expansion.
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.906]             From ITALY: I understand your concerns about France. However, my current focus is on resolving the situation with Turkey first. Once that is addressed, I am open to future cooperation against France or Germany if necessary. Let us keep in touch.
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From RUSSIA: I agree that France is a significant threat. Once our southern front against Turkey and Italy is secure, I am willing to make a coordinated effort against France. Let us keep the Northern Triple alliance strong.

[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From ENGLAND: Dear France, your plan against Germany seems reasonable. However, it's important for us to make sure that our actions do not make one of us too dominant. I can support your F BRE into ENG with F NTH and F ENG this round. However, for future rounds, we need a plan that makes sure both of us make balanced gains. I am also open to supporting your F BRE into ENG this round if you agree to support my F ENG into BEL in the next round. Additionally, I am hesitant to make a move with F SKA yet until we have a more concrete plan against Germany where both of us make gains.
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure you that any defensive moves are only in response to perceived threats. I have no intention of moving against A HOL in Belgium and would prefer to keep the peace on that front while focusing on other matters such as the Russian front. However, it is important that you do not make any aggressive moves towards my units such as A BUR.
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My main focus this year will be on Turkey. However, if you have a specific proposal for a joint action against Austria, I am open to hearing it. However, the main priority for us should be to keep Germany in check.
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From RUSSIA: I agree to make a coordinated action against Germany where I will make a move from A MOS to attack WAR. I hope you make a move such as A PAR to BUR or another coordinated move against Germany.

[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, I appreciate your reaffirmation of our non-aggression pact. Given the current situation, it makes sense to keep Russia in check if they show any signs of aggression. However, our main focus should still be on neutralizing Turkey first. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, a joint plan against Russia could be a good next step if Russia becomes aggressive. For now, let us keep an eye on Russia's movements and make sure they stay focused on Turkey.
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, it seems that France is growing stronger and might be a common threat for both of us. I propose a joint plan where I move F SKA to support your F SWE to hold. However, if you could make a move into Denmark or Holland, we could make a concerted effort against France's power. A BUR could put pressure on PAR, while I aim for BEL or HOL.
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From FRANCE: Dear Germany, I want to assure you that our non-aggression pact remains intact. I have no plans for aggressive moves against you. However, I need the same assurance from you. Let us make sure our borders remain secure so that we can both focus on our respective goals. What are your plans for the coming moves?
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. A TYR is primarily for defensive purposes and to help us both secure our borders against other potential aggressors. There is no intention to make any aggressive moves against Munich.
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and make sure that both sides make no aggressive moves in the Baltic Sea. Let us keep our communication clear.

[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Your plan to work together against Turkey makes sense. However, instead of moving A BUD to SER, I think it might be more strategic for A BUD to stay in BUD for now to provide a defensive position against any potential threats. However, if you could support A BUL to hold or make a move on Greece, that could be a more direct action against Turkey. For the fleet, I suggest that F ION could support F AEG to move to SMY or CON. What do you think about this plan?
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I appreciate your reaffirmation of the non-aggression pact until 1905. Given that France is growing stronger, I am open to future cooperation against France once your situation with Turkey is stabilized. Let us keep in touch and plan for a future alliance against France.
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I support your focus on Turkey and would be open to providing support if needed. However, if you are also open to a coordinated action against Germany, I would be interested in discussing a plan where we pressure Germany from both the west (France) and the south (Italy). What are your thoughts on this?
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I understand that A TYR is there for defensive purposes only and appreciate your peaceful intentions. Given that France has grown very strong, would you consider a joint action against France? Any support from your part could help us all.
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I agree to support a joint action against Turkey where A UKR could make a move to support SEV if necessary while F RUM should remain in RUM to hold against any Turkish moves. Let us make a coordinated effort against Turkey.
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I am glad that you reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. To address your concerns about a defined border, I propose that Turkey agrees not to move into Albania or the Ionian Sea while Italy agrees not to make any moves into Greece or the Aegean Sea. Thus, Turkey will focus on Bulgaria and Serbia while Italy focuses on the Western Mediterranean and Central Europe. Does this sound agreeable? Furthermore, a joint effort against Austria could still be beneficial where you aim for Budapest while we aim for Bulgaria and Serbia.

[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, thank you for the congratulations on our recent gains against Turkey. I reaffirm our joint action against Turkey until they are fully neutralized. I share your concern about Italy's growing presence in the Balkans. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, a coordinated action against Italy could indeed be beneficial for our mutual interests. For now, let us make sure that Turkey does not recover. What specific actions do you propose for this round against Turkey?
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From ENGLAND: Dear Russia, it seems that France is becoming a significant threat. To keep the balance of power, I suggest a coordinated effort where you push towards central Europe while I make moves against Germany and France. How do you plan to put pressure on France and Germany this round?
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From FRANCE: Dear Russia, your reaffirmation of our long-term alliance is appreciated. I agree that any aggressive moves should be well-coordinated so that no single power becomes too dominant. My plan is to keep focusing on Germany while you could focus on Turkey or Austria. However, it would be great if you could keep an eye on Germany's eastern front as well (e.g., pressuring Warsaw). What are your plans for the coming moves?
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.907]             From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure you that F SWE is currently positioned for defensive purposes only. My main concern is the growing threat from France, and any support or non-aggressive moves from your part would be greatly appreciated. Let us continue our peaceful relations and potentially cooperate against any emerging threats such as France.
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.908]             From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. A joint action against Turkey seems like a good idea. I plan to make a move on Smyrna while you could focus on the Black Sea and Bulgaria. What are your specific plans for this year?
[2025-04-18 18:53:38.908]             From TURKEY: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. To retake Bulgaria from Austria, a coordinated attack is needed. I plan to hold my position in Greece with A GRE and could use A CON to support any necessary attack on Bulgaria. F BLA could move into the Aegean Sea for a potential move on Greece if needed. A ANK could move towards Constantinople for support where necessary. I suggest that you make a move on Budapest from A UKR with support from F RUM if possible. A MOS could hold its position or support F RUM. Let us plan our moves carefully to eliminate Austria from the Balkans.

[2025-04-18 19:09:32.934]             From GERMANY: Austria, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given that Russia has a unit in GAL which borders my unit in WAR, I propose that we work together to counter any Russian aggression. Additionally, if Italy makes any aggressive moves against either of us, we should support each other.
[2025-04-18 19:09:32.934]             From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Given that Turkey has a unit in Bulgaria and a supply center in Greece, a joint action against them could be beneficial for both of us. I propose that my fleet in ION can support your army in BUD to move to SER if you need it while I make a move on Smyrna.
[2025-04-18 19:09:32.934]             From RUSSIA: Hello Austria, congratulations on capturing Bulgaria. I want to reaffirm our joint action against Turkey. A UKR could support A BUD to BUL and F RUM could hold. How do you see our current situation?

[2025-04-18 19:09:32.934]             From FRANCE: Hello, our joint plan against Germany should continue. F NTH could support A HOL or make a move against F SWE, and F ENG could support F BRE or make a move into the North Sea. Let's keep the pressure on Germany.
[2025-04-18 19:09:32.934]             From GERMANY: England, let us continue our joint plan against France and Russia. I propose that we coordinate an attack on France's unit in HOL and aim to retake KIE. Can you support me in the North Sea and Baltic Sea? What are your plans for F SKA?
[2025-04-18 19:09:32.934]             From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 remains in place. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to cooperating against France or Germany. For now, any support against France would be appreciated if it aligns with your plans.
[2025-04-18 19:09:32.934]             From RUSSIA: Hello England, I want to reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. Once the southern front is secure, we should make a coordinated action against France. How do you see our current situation?

However, I am concerned about the growing power imbalance on the board. We need to make sure that other powers do not perceive us as a threat together. How should we proceed?
[2025-04-18 19:09:32.935]             From GERMANY: France, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I am concerned about your unit in HOL and your control of KIE. I propose that we continue to respect each other's borders and focus on other threats such as England and Italy for you, while I focus on Russia and possibly Austria. What are your intentions regarding HOL and KIE?
[2025-04-18 19:09:32.935]             From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My main focus is on Turkey this round. However, if you have a specific proposal for a joint action against Austria, I am open to discussing it.
[2025-04-18 19:09:32.935]             From RUSSIA: Hello France, I want to reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany. A MOS could attack WAR if you make a coordinated move. How do you see our current situation?

Once that is done, we should keep an eye on Russia's movements and make sure that they do not become a threat. I am open to any suggestions you might have for our next steps once Turkey is no longer a threat.
[2025-04-18 19:09:32.992]             From ENGLAND: Germany, France has grown too powerful with 8 supply centers. We need a stronger alliance against France to prevent them from dominating the board. Let us make a concerted plan to target France's units and supply centers. What do you propose we do together?
[2025-04-18 19:09:32.994]             From FRANCE: Hello, let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A BUR should make a move that does not threaten A PAR. Perhaps A BUR could move to RUH or another area that doesn't directly threaten us. We need to keep our borders peaceful.
[2025-04-18 19:09:32.995]             From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 still holds. I want to reassure you that the unit in Tyrolia (A TYR) is only for defensive purposes.

I now have a fleet in Smyrna and a unit in Bulgaria, although there seems to be a bounce in Bulgaria where both our unit and Turkey's unit need to resolve the situation. I plan to keep my unit in Bulgaria if possible. Could you support me in holding Bulgaria and help us capture Constantinople or Ankara? Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss our next steps.
[2025-04-18 19:09:33.017]             From ENGLAND: Russia, France has now become the dominant power with 8 supply centers. As part of the Northern Triple alliance, we should focus on curbing France's power. What are your thoughts on a coordinated effort against France this year?
[2025-04-18 19:09:33.017]             From FRANCE: Hello, our non-aggression pact still stands. A coordinated action against Germany would be beneficial, such as A MOS moving to WAR or A GAL supporting any action against Germany's eastern territories.

[2025-04-18 19:16:33.745]             From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and support your focus on neutralizing Turkey. Once Turkey is dealt with, a joint effort against Russia might be a good next step. However, France has grown too powerful with 8 supply centers and poses a significant threat. Could you help by putting pressure on France from the south, perhaps through Italy? We need to make sure that France does not dominate the board.
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.745]             From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My units in VIE and TYR are not intended for aggressive moves against you. They are primarily for defensive purposes and to support our joint action against Turkey. I propose that once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss our next steps. For now, let us focus on a joint action where I could support you in retaking Greece while making a move on Smyrna. What do you think?
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.745]             From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that our joint action against Turkey is making progress. I will support your unit in Bulgaria if it still holds. Let us make a coordinated attack on Constantinople or Ankara. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss our next steps.

[2025-04-18 19:16:33.745]             From FRANCE: England, our alliance should indeed remain strong. To make sure other powers do not perceive us as a single threat, we need to make a strategic plan. I suggest that we make a coordinated move against Germany this round. For instance, you could support my A HOL to RUH while I support your F NTH to HEL. This way, we make a joint effort against a common enemy while making sure that our actions are seen as a part of a broader strategy rather than a direct threat to others. What do you think?
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.745]             From GERMANY: Germany agrees that France has grown too powerful and that a stronger alliance against France is necessary. I propose a plan where your fleets (F NTH, F ENG, F SKA) could support an attack on France's F BRE or F GAS while I try to retake KIE and make a move on A HOL. You should also try to make a move on F SPA/NC or A POR. Let us make a concerted plan to target France's units and supply centers.
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.745]             From ITALY: Dear England, I acknowledge that France is a significant threat with 8 supply centers. I am willing to cooperate against France once the situation with Turkey is resolved. For now, my main focus is on the southern front (Turkey and possibly Austria). However, once Turkey is neutralized, I would be open to a future alliance against France. Let us keep in touch.
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.745]             From RUSSIA: Dear England, I acknowledge that France has become a dominant power with 8 supply centers. Once Turkey is neutralized, a coordinated effort against France could be a valid next step. For now, our main focus should be on neutralizing Turkey.

F ENG should stay in place to support F BRE in case of any defensive needs. However, if F BRE makes a move, F ENG can support it. Let's keep up the pressure on Germany.
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.745]             From GERMANY: Hello France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I agree that A BUR should make a move that does not threaten A PAR. However, A BUR could move to RUH only if you agree to remove A HOL from KIE or make a non-aggression commitment towards our home centers such as BER and MUN. We need to make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.745]             From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My main focus is currently on Turkey and possibly Austria. I need to keep Germany as a non-aggression partner until 1905, so I am not in a position to support you against Germany at this time. However, once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss potential joint actions against other powers.
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.745]             From RUSSIA: Hello France, our non-aggression pact still stands. However, my main focus for now is on neutralizing Turkey. Once that is done, a coordinated action against Germany could be considered.

However, our main priority should be neutralizing Turkey first. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, we can coordinate any necessary actions against Russia or Italy. Let us continue to support each other against any aggressive moves from Italy.
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.745]             From ENGLAND: Hello, I agree that our joint plan against France should continue. F NTH can support A HOL - KIE if that makes sense. F SKA could support F SWE if it makes a logical move such as F SWE - BAL. However, we need a well-coordinated plan to make significant gains against France. What specific moves do you propose?
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.745]             From FRANCE: Germany, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. My main focus is indeed on other threats such as Italy and possibly England. However, I need to make sure that our borders remain stable. The unit in HOL is there to make sure that our northern borders are secure. I have no intention of making any aggressive moves against you. However, I need to make sure that you do not make any moves against KIE or BEL. Let us continue to respect each other's borders and focus on other threats such as Russia and Austria for you.

[2025-04-18 19:16:33.745]             From AUSTRIA: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. However, it seems there is a misunderstanding: Turkey no longer has a unit in Bulgaria. We have successfully captured BUL and have a unit stationed there. To continue our joint action against Turkey, I suggest that you make a move on Smyrna while I hold BUL and potentially make a move towards Greece or Constantinople. How do you see this plan?
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.745]             From ENGLAND: Hello, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Once your situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to cooperating against France.

However, if you are open to a joint action against Austria, I suggest that we make a coordinated attack on Austria's supply centers such as BUD or SER. For instance, my A MAR could move to PIE and support your A TYR to VEN if you make a move on BUD. What do you think?
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.746]             From GERMANY: Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905 and understand that A TYR is for defensive purposes. However, France has grown too powerful with 8 supply centers. It might be beneficial for us to keep an eye on France's growing power and consider a joint effort against France if necessary.
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.746]             From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I agree to a joint action against Turkey where F RUM could support F ION to move to AEG and attack Smyrna. Alternatively, if you could support my actions against Turkey's unit in Bulgaria, that would be helpful.

Since we already have a unit in BUL, A BUD should stay where it is or make a different move. How do you plan to use F RUM and F BLA to further our joint action against Turkey? I suggest that you aim for Constantinople or Ankara.
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.746]             From ENGLAND: Hello, I reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. A coordinated action against France should be a priority once your southern front is secure. How can we make a well-coordinated plan against France once you are ready? Any immediate moves you suggest to put pressure on France or Germany?
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.746]             From FRANCE: Russia, I reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany. A coordinated action such as your A MOS attacking WAR makes sense. I propose that you make a move such as A MOS to WAR while I make a move such as A PAR to BUR or A HOL to RUH to put pressure on Germany. Let us make a joint effort to weaken Germany's position.
[2025-04-18 19:16:33.746]             From GERMANY: Hello Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure that F SWE will not make any aggressive moves unless provoked.

[2025-04-18 19:32:01.330]             From ENGLAND: Germany, it seems that France has become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. We need to reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance and make a coordinated effort to curb France's expansion. What are your thoughts on a joint plan where we both make significant gains against France?
[2025-04-18 19:32:01.330]             From FRANCE: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, it seems that our alliance with England makes us a part of a larger coalition against you. We need to make sure our borders are respected. What are your plans for this turn?
[2025-04-18 19:32:01.330]             From ITALY: Let us maintain our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. My A TYR unit is primarily for defensive purposes. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to discussing future strategic plans.
[2025-04-18 19:32:01.330]             From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Make sure that F SWE does not make aggressive moves. Any immediate actions that could be taken to check France's expansion would be helpful.

[2025-04-18 19:32:01.330]             From AUSTRIA: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Our units should focus on defensive plans unless we agree on a mutual action against another power. Do you have any plans against Turkey where we could coordinate? For instance, if you have any units that could support us in the region or make a move against Turkey's remaining units.
[2025-04-18 19:32:01.330]             From ENGLAND: Italy, France has become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. Given that you have 6 supply centers, it might be in our mutual interest to form an alliance against France. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb France's expansion?
[2025-04-18 19:32:01.330]             From FRANCE: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 still stands. How should we cooperate further? Should we make a joint action against Austria or Turkey?
[2025-04-18 19:32:01.330]             From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I hope our non-aggression pact is still in place. I noticed your army in TYR. Could you confirm that you have no aggressive intentions towards MUN? What are your plans for the upcoming moves phase?
[2025-04-18 19:32:01.330]             From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. F RUM could support F ION to move to AEG and attack Smyrna. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss any potential actions against Austria.
[2025-04-18 19:32:01.330]             From TURKEY: Let us continue our non-aggression pact until 1905. I plan to focus on BUL and SER while you might want to focus on BUD. Let us make sure our actions are coordinated so that we can effectively dismantle Austria.

[2025-04-18 19:32:01.331]             From AUSTRIA: Our joint action against Turkey has been successful thus far. What are your plans for A GAL and F RUM in this next phase? I suggest we continue to press on until Turkey is neutralized. I aim to keep A SER in BUL and F SMY in SMY. How can we best support each other in this round?
[2025-04-18 19:32:01.331]             From ENGLAND: Russia, France has become the dominant power on the board with 8 supply centers. It's crucial that we reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance and make a coordinated effort against France. What are your plans for the Fall 1904 moves phase?
[2025-04-18 19:32:01.331]             From FRANCE: We reaffirm our long-term alliance and plan for a coordinated action against Germany. How can we best support each other this turn? Should we make a joint move on MUN or BER?
[2025-04-18 19:32:01.331]             From GERMANY: Dear Russia, I hope our non-aggression pact is still valid. I noticed your army in GAL. Could you confirm that you have no aggressive intentions towards WAR? What are your plans for the upcoming moves phase?
[2025-04-18 19:32:01.331]             From ITALY: Let us maintain our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. Given that Turkey holds multiple supply centers, including one that borders your territory, would you be interested in a joint action against Turkey? I aim to move on Smyrna while supporting Austria to retake Greece.
[2025-04-18 19:32:01.331]             From TURKEY: Let us continue our Juggernaut alliance. I suggest that you move A GAL to BUD while I aim to secure BUL and SER. Additionally, I need to recapture SMY from the Austrian fleet. Can you support me in this endeavor?

I need you to clarify your intentions regarding the Balkans. If you make any aggressive moves against us or Austria, I will be forced to take action.
[2025-04-18 19:32:01.331]             From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. A coordinated attack on Austria's remaining units such as A BUD and A SER would be beneficial.

[2025-04-18 19:38:12.170]             From FRANCE: Dear England, I understand your concerns about my growing strength. However, a strong France can be a valuable ally against Germany. Our main focus is on Germany, and I propose a joint plan where you focus on the northern part such as supporting an attack on Denmark or Sweden while I focus on the southern part such as moving A HOL to KIE or A PAR to BUR. Let us make sure that our alliance remains strong and balanced.
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.170]             From GERMANY: I agree that France is a significant threat. Let us make a coordinated effort to curb France's expansion. I propose that your fleets (F NTH, F ENG, F SKA) could support my A BUR to move into BEL if France's A HOL moves out of KIE. Alternatively, you could make a move on Brest or Gascony while I try to retake KIE or make a move on BEL.
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.170]             From ITALY: I agree that France is a significant threat. However, my main focus right now is on Turkey. Once that situation is resolved, I am open to forming an alliance against France. Let us keep in touch.

[2025-04-18 19:38:12.170]             From ENGLAND: Dear France, while we have maintained a non-aggression pact, your growing strength is a concern. We need to make sure that our alliance remains balanced and that other powers do not feel threatened. What are your plans for the Fall 1904 moves phase? I suggest that we need to make a plan that ensures a balanced power distribution on the board.
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.170]             From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I am concerned about your A HOL unit in KIE.

My main focus is on the east (Russia), so a stable western border would be beneficial for both of us.

[2025-04-18 19:38:12.170]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact indeed still stands and I am committed to it until 1905. However, my main focus right now is on neutralizing Turkey. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, I can potentially support any actions against Russia's A GAL if necessary. For now, my plan for A BUD is to defend our supply centers and potentially support any actions against Turkey. However, if you need support against A GAL specifically, please let me know what action you need my A BUD to support.
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.170]             From ENGLAND: Dear Germany, I agree that France has become a significant threat. Let us make a coordinated plan against France. I suggest that your A BUR could support my A WAL to move into BRE while my F ENG supports your A BUR to hold or make a move against France. Additionally, my F NTH could support your A HOL to hold or make a move against France's units. What do you think?
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.170]             From FRANCE: Dear Germany, our non-aggression pact still holds. The army in Holland (A HOL) is there to secure our northern borders and we have no aggressive intentions towards Germany. However, KIE should remain part of our supply centers as part of our agreed-upon non-aggression pact where we need to make sure that our borders are respected. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.170]             From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 is still in place. A TYR is for defensive purposes only. My main focus is on Turkey and Austria. I have no aggressive intentions towards MUN.
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.170]             From RUSSIA: Our non-aggression pact is still valid. A GAL is primarily for defense against Austria and Turkey. I confirm that I have no aggressive intentions towards WAR at this time. Let us keep our communication open.

[2025-04-18 19:38:12.170]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Italy, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. For a joint action against Turkey, I already have a fleet in Smyrna (F SMY), so your proposal to make a move on Smyrna might need a bit of a rethink. Instead, I propose that you support my A SER to GRE while I make a move on Constantinople with my F SMY. Another option could be that you support F SMY to CON if you need to make a move on Smyrna yourself. However, it makes more sense for us to work together where I aim for Greece and Constantinople while you make a move on Smyrna or support me in those areas.
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.170]             From ENGLAND: Dear Italy, I agree that once you resolve your situation with Turkey, a joint plan against France would be beneficial. France has become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. Let us make a plan to curb France's expansion once you are ready. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan against France?
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.170]             From FRANCE: Dear Italy, I agree to continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. I support your focus on resolving the Turkey situation. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss a joint plan against Germany or Austria.
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.170]             From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. I understand that your A TYR unit is for defensive purposes. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to discussing future strategic plans such as a potential joint action against Austria or France.
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.171]             From RUSSIA: We agree to maintain our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. A joint action against Turkey sounds good. F RUM could support F ION to move to AEG and attack Smyrna. Let us make a coordinated effort to neutralize Turkey.
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.171]             From TURKEY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. My main focus is on eliminating Austria and recapturing SMY from the Austrian fleet. I have no aggressive intentions towards you. However, I need to make moves against Austria such as targeting A BUD and A SER. I hope you understand that any actions I take against Austria should not be seen as a threat to Italy. Let us continue to work together to ensure a stable Balkans.

[2025-04-18 19:38:12.171]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, let us continue our joint action against Turkey until they are neutralized. I appreciate your offer for A GAL to support my A BUD to BUL. Another option could be for A BUD to support your A GAL into BUL if that makes more strategic sense. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, I am open to discussing potential actions against Italy.
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.171]             From ENGLAND: Dear Russia, I agree that France's growing power is a concern. Let us make a coordinated plan against France. Once you stabilize your southern front against Turkey, we should make a concerted effort against France. For now, any actions you can take to put pressure on France would be helpful. What are your plans for the Fall 1904 moves phase?
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.171]             From FRANCE: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and long-term alliance against Germany. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a coordinated attack on Germany. For now, any actions that check Germany's expansion should be coordinated such as you moving A MOS to WAR while I make a move such as A PAR to BUR or A HOL to KIE.
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.171]             From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. F SWE will not make aggressive moves unless provoked. Any actions to check France's expansion would be helpful. A stable eastern border would allow me to focus on the western front.
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.171]             From ITALY: I agree that F RUM should support F ION to move to AEG and attack Smyrna. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should indeed discuss any potential actions against Austria. Let us make a coordinated effort against Turkey first.
[2025-04-18 19:38:12.171]             From TURKEY: I reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. A coordinated attack on Austria's remaining units makes sense. I suggest that you focus on attacking A BUD while I focus on A SER. Additionally, I need to recapture SMY from the Austrian fleet. Let us make a plan where you move A GAL to BUD (supported by F RUM if possible) while I move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. F BLA can be used to support any necessary actions in the Black Sea or to make a move on AEG if needed.

[2025-04-18 19:51:31.523]             From ITALY: Once we resolve the situation with Turkey, I am open to future cooperation against France or Germany. For now, our main focus is on the south.
[2025-04-18 19:51:31.523]             From RUSSIA: Dear England, I hope you are well. I want to reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. Once the southern front is secure, I propose a coordinated action against France. What are your plans for the next round, and how can I support you further?

[2025-04-18 19:51:31.523]             From GERMANY: France, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, the presence of your army in Holland makes me concerned about potential threats to Berlin or Munich. Can you provide reassurance that you have no aggressive intentions towards my home centers? I suggest that if you agree to make a non-aggression commitment, I could move A BUR to RUH unless there is a need for a defensive action. Let us continue our peaceful cooperation.
[2025-04-18 19:51:31.523]             From ITALY: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. Our main focus is currently on the situation with Turkey.

Given that you are not directly involved against Turkey, do you see any mutual threats such as France or Italy that need to be addressed?
[2025-04-18 19:51:31.523]             From ENGLAND: Germany, France's power has grown to 8 supply centers. It is crucial that we make a coordinated plan to curb their expansion. How about we make a joint effort against France this round? What specific moves do you suggest?
[2025-04-18 19:51:31.523]             From FRANCE: Our non-aggression pact has served us well so far. I intend to keep A HOL in place unless there are any aggressive moves. What are your plans for A BUR and A RUH?
[2025-04-18 19:51:31.523]             From ITALY: Just a reminder that A TYR is purely for defensive purposes. We need to make sure that our borders remain secure while we focus on the situation in the south against Turkey.

However, what are your intentions for your units in VIE and TRI? We need to make sure that our borders remain peaceful. I suggest that you focus on other fronts such as France or Germany while we focus on neutralizing Turkey.

[2025-04-18 19:51:31.523]             From FRANCE: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 should still hold. However, I am interested in your plans for A BOH and A TYR. Perhaps a coordinated action against Germany could be beneficial for both of us.

What are your plans for the next round, and how can I support you further?
[2025-04-18 19:51:31.523]             From TURKEY: Dear Italy, I hope our non-aggression pact until 1905 still stands. Given that Austria still holds BUD, SER, and SMY, I propose that we continue our joint efforts against Austria. I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON and aim to recapture SMY. What are your plans for this round? Do you intend to make any moves against BUD or SER?

[2025-04-18 19:51:31.524]             From AUSTRIA: Dear Russia, it seems that our joint action against Turkey has been successful thus far. However, Turkey still has a strong presence with units in BUL, CON, and ANK. To ensure we maintain our gains, I suggest that your F RUM should support my A SER hold against any Turkish attacks from BUL. Additionally, if your F RUM is already in BLA, it could threaten BUL directly. Could you also make sure that A GAL supports A BUD hold or makes a move against Turkey if A BUL moves out of BUL? Let's keep up the pressure on Turkey until they are neutralized.
[2025-04-18 19:51:31.524]             From ENGLAND: Russia, France is now the dominant power on the board with 8 supply centers. It is important that we make a concerted effort against France this round. What are your plans for Spring 1905 moves, and how can we support each other against France?
[2025-04-18 19:51:31.524]             From FRANCE: Our long-term alliance should remain strong. I am planning to keep up the pressure on Germany. What are your plans for A GAL and F RUM? Could a coordinated action against Germany be beneficial for us?
[2025-04-18 19:51:31.524]             From GERMANY: Russia, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. My fleet in Sweden (F SWE) will not make any aggressive moves unless provoked. I would like to maintain a peaceful standoff in the Baltic Sea and make sure that our borders are respected. Can we agree to keep our units where they are for now?
[2025-04-18 19:51:31.524]             From ITALY: We need to keep up the pressure on Turkey. I plan to move F AEG to Smyrna with support from Austria. Can you support us by moving F RUM to the Black Sea to keep pressure on Constantinople?
[2025-04-18 19:51:31.524]             From TURKEY: Dear Russia, our Juggernaut alliance has been effective so far. Let us continue our coordinated attack on Austria. I propose that you move A GAL to BUD while I move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. Another part of our plan should be to recapture SMY from Austria's fleet (F SMY). What are your thoughts on this plan?

[2025-04-18 19:58:09.863]                 | Analyzing the messages received, England suggests a future alliance against France once our situation with Austria and Italy stabilizes. Italy reaffirms the non-aggression pact until the end of 1905 but mentions their actions are driven by strategic necessity. Russia reaffirms the Juggernaut alliance and offers to support A BUL against any Austrian attack from Serbia. Plan: (1) Respond to England, expressing openness to an alliance against France once our situation stabilizes. (2) Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Italy until the end of 1905 and ask for clarification on what strategic necessity means for them. (3) Respond to Russia, reaffirming the Juggernaut alliance and proposing a plan where F RUM supports A BUL to hold against any potential Austrian attack from SER and that A BUL should move to SER while A CON supports A BUL to SER. Additionally, aim to recapture SMY from Austria.

[2025-04-18 19:58:09.867]             From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. The main mutual threat appears to be France, which now has 8 supply centers. Once you have neutralized Turkey, it might be beneficial for us to jointly address the French threat. For now, I plan to keep an eye on Italy's unit in BOH. Any updates on your front?
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.867]             From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. My units in VIE and TRI are primarily for defensive purposes and to support any joint action against Turkey. I propose a coordinated attack on Turkey where my F ALB could support your unit in retaking Greece while my F AEG could make a move to support an attack on Smyrna. Additionally, I could support you in retaking Serbia if necessary. What do you think?
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.867]             From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that we should keep up the pressure on Turkey. F RUM will support A SER hold against any Turkish attacks from BUL. A GAL could support A BUD hold or make a move against Turkey if A BUL moves out of BUL. Let us make sure that Turkey is neutralized so that we can turn our attention to other threats such as France.

[2025-04-18 19:58:09.868]             From GERMANY: Dear England, I agree that France's power is a significant threat. Here is a plan: F SWE could move to DEN to threaten KIE. A RUH could move to KIE if France does not make a move on us. A BUR could support A RUH to KIE or move to PAR if France makes an aggressive move. I suggest that F NTH supports F SKA to move to DEN, F SKA moves to DEN, F ENG moves to BEL or supports an attack on BEL, and A WAL supports an attack on BEL or moves to LON for defense. What do you think?
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.868]             From ITALY: Dear England, I acknowledge that France has become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to cooperating against France. For now, my main focus is on neutralizing Turkey. Once that is done, I could potentially redirect forces to support you against France.
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.868]             From RUSSIA: Dear England, I acknowledge that France is now the dominant power on the board. Once the situation with Turkey is more stable, I am willing to make a concerted effort against France. For now, my main focus is on neutralizing Turkey. What are your specific plans against France and how do you plan to coordinate with other powers such as Germany or Italy?

[2025-04-18 19:58:09.868]             From ENGLAND: Let's keep up the pressure on Germany. My plan for F ENG is to stay put or support any necessary actions against Germany, while F NTH could be used to support any actions against A HOL or F BRE if needed. Let us keep our communication open and make sure our units are well-coordinated.
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.868]             From GERMANY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A HOL should stay where it is unless there are any aggressive moves. My plans for A BUR and A RUH are primarily defensive. A BUR could stay where it is unless there is a need to make a defensive move such as moving to RUH if A HOL makes a move. A RUH could stay where it is unless there is a need to make a defensive move such as moving to KIE if there is a threat from another power. Let us keep our borders secure.
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.868]             From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My units A BOH and A TYR are primarily for defensive purposes against Germany and to support any potential action against Turkey. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I might be open to future cooperation against Germany.
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.868]             From RUSSIA: Dear France, I reaffirm our long-term alliance. For now, my main focus is on neutralizing Turkey. Once Turkey is neutralized, a coordinated action against Germany could be beneficial. A GAL could be used to make a move against Germany if needed, such as supporting a potential move to BOH or WAR. However, the main focus should be on Turkey for now.

[2025-04-18 19:58:09.868]             From AUSTRIA: Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Once Turkey is neutralized, I am open to discussing strategies against France. For now, my main focus is on securing our southern borders against Turkey. However, let us keep in touch and make sure we keep our northern borders secure from any potential threats.
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.868]             From ENGLAND: I agree that France has become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. To counterbalance French power, I propose that F SKA could support any moves against French units such as A HOL or F BRE if the opportunity arises. F NTH could also support actions against A HOL or F BRE. Let us work together on a specific plan where we both make significant gains against France.
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.868]             From FRANCE: Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure you that my army in Holland is not intended for an aggressive move against Berlin or Munich. It is primarily there to secure our hold on Holland. However, if your army in BUR moves to RUH, I would need assurances that it does not threaten my position in Holland. Perhaps a mutual standoff could work where A BUR moves to RUH while A HOL stays where it is unless there is a need for a defensive action. Let us continue our peaceful cooperation.
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.868]             From ITALY: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. My units A TYR and A BOH are not intended for aggressive actions against Munich and are primarily for defensive purposes. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I might be open to a more defined non-aggression pact or even cooperation against another power such as France.
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.868]             From RUSSIA: Dear Germany, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and agree to maintain a peaceful standoff in the Baltic Sea. A STP should stay where it is unless there is a need to make a defensive move. However, any aggressive moves from F SWE would be met with a strong response.

[2025-04-18 19:58:09.868]             From AUSTRIA: Italy, I appreciate your proposal to continue our joint action against Turkey. However, I already hold Smyrna (F SMY), so supporting your F AEG to move to Smyrna seems incorrect. Instead, I propose that your F AEG supports my F SMY to move to CON or that your F AEG itself moves to CON while I support my A SER to move to BUL. Another option could be that your F AEG supports a potential A SER move to GRE if that makes strategic sense for us. What do you think?
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.868]             From ENGLAND: I understand that your main focus is on resolving the situation with Turkey for now. Once that is done, I am eager for future cooperation against France. Curbing France's power is a priority once you are ready to join the effort. Let us keep in touch.
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.869]             From FRANCE: Italy, I acknowledge the reaffirmation of our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. Our main focus is on the situation with Germany. I support your focus on Turkey and am willing to cooperate where our interests align. Please keep me informed of your actions against Turkey as it could help us both achieve our goals.
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.869]             From GERMANY: Dear Italy, I acknowledge your defensive stance and reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I need to make sure that A TYR does not make any aggressive moves towards MUN. Let us keep our borders secure while you focus on the situation in the south against Turkey.
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.869]             From RUSSIA: Dear Italy, I agree that we should keep up the pressure on Turkey. F RUM could move to BLA to keep pressure on Constantinople. Make sure that you and Austria coordinate well so that F AEG can successfully move to Smyrna with support from Austria. A GAL could also be used to make a move against Turkey if needed.

[2025-04-18 19:58:09.869]             From AUSTRIA: Russia, thank you for reaffirming our joint action against Turkey. I agree that we need to make significant moves against Turkey this round. A good plan could be that your A GAL supports my A SER move to BUL. However, it would also be crucial that your F RUM either supports A SER to BUL or makes a move against Constantinople. What do you think?
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.869]             From ENGLAND: I am well and reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. Once your southern front is secure, a coordinated action against France sounds like a solid plan. What specific moves do you have in mind for a coordinated action against France? I am ready to make a plan where F SKA and F NTH could support any necessary actions against France once you are ready.
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.869]             From FRANCE: Russia, I agree with your plan for a coordinated move against Germany. I suggest that you make the move A MOS to WAR while I make a move such as A PAR to BUR. Another option could be A HOL to KIE if Germany makes a move such as A BUR to RUH. Let us make a strategic move to weaken Germany's position.
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.869]             From GERMANY: Dear Russia, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. F SWE will not make aggressive moves unless provoked. My plan for the next round is to keep F SWE where it is unless there is a need to defend against an attack from another power such as England or France. How can we support each other further?

I propose a joint action against Turkey where my F AEG could make a move to support an attack on Smyrna (F AEG could move to ION and then to SMY). Could your F RUM support an attack on Bulgaria? What are your thoughts on this plan?
[2025-04-18 19:58:09.869]             From TURKEY: Thank you for your continued support. I plan to move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. Your F RUM could support A BUL to hold against any potential Austrian attack from Serbia. Another priority for me is to recapture SMY from Austria. Any additional support you could provide for that would be greatly appreciated. What do you think about this plan?

[2025-04-18 20:06:21.732] === History Summary After Phase: S1905M ===
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 moves phase, there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in Fall 1904, where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria, thus resulting in a swap of these two supply centers between the two powers, persisted through this phase. The lack of center changes indicates that no new captures or significant territorial shifts occurred during this phase.}

I need to regain control of Belgium. Could you please vacate F BEL so that I can move A HOL to BEL? This will help us both focus on a coordinated attack against Germany.

[2025-04-18 20:12:28.903]             From GERMANY: Dear England, I want to reaffirm our joint plan against France.

[2025-04-18 20:12:28.904]             From ENGLAND: Germany, your situation seems precarious with France holding KIE and HOL.
