  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I hope we can confirm our non-aggression pact. Let us avoid conflict in the Adriatic area so that you can focus on the Balkans and potentially against Russia while I focus on the Mediterranean. What are your plans for this round?
  From RUSSIA: I am still committed to our joint action against Turkey where you aim for Greece and Serbia while I aim for Bulgaria and Rumania. However, Turkey has a fleet in BLA and an army in BUL, so we need to coordinate our moves carefully. What are your plans for this round?

  From GERMANY: Thank you for agreeing to a non-aggression pact. Given that we both face threats from Russia and potentially Italy, it makes sense for us to support each other if one of us is attacked. For now, I plan to make no aggressive moves against you and hope you will do the same.
  From ITALY: Hello, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given our mutual interests in the Balkans, would you be interested in a coordinated action against Turkey? Perhaps we could discuss a plan where we both make moves that could help us gain more supply centers in the region.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Austria, it seems that our joint action against Turkey has been successful for you so far. I hope we can continue to work together to keep Turkey in check. What are your plans for this round?

  From ITALY: Hello, thank you for reaching out. Our non-aggression pact stands firm. A TYR is primarily for defensive purposes and to make sure our borders are secure. It might also be used to support action against another power such as Turkey if there is mutual agreement. However, I need to make sure our borders are safe from any potential threats. Could you provide details on your plans for your units in Trieste and Serbia?
  From RUSSIA: I agree that we should continue our joint action against Turkey. I plan to support your moves against Turkey where possible. For this round, I suggest that A GAL could support your A BUD to hold its position if necessary or make a move on BUL if you support it. F RUM could support an Austrian move into BUL or hold its position to prevent Turkish advances. Let us make sure that our borders remain secure while we make gains against Turkey.

  From GERMANY: Hello Austria. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Currently, I need to address some issues with France and Russia. The French unit in KIE is a major concern for us. I am also trying to clarify a dispute with Russia over Sweden. Any support or coordination against Russia would be welcome.
  From ITALY: Hello, thank you for the update. Our non-aggression pact is indeed holding. Currently, I do not have a fleet in the Ionian Sea (F ION) to support any action against Turkey. However, once I establish a fleet there, I am open to discussing such coordinated actions. Let us keep up the good work.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Austria, it seems that our joint action against Turkey did not result in any new supply center changes, largely due to defensive actions by Turkey and Italy's intervention in the Balkans. However, let us reaffirm our alliance against Turkey and make a new plan for the next year where you aim for Greece and Serbia while I aim for Bulgaria and Rumania. Let us make a coordinated effort in Spring 1903.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, our non-aggression pact still stands. Our main focus is on defensive and strategic positioning for A VIE and A TRI. We need to make sure that these units are well-positioned against any potential threats. However, there is no intention for an immediate attack on your units unless provoked. Let us keep our lines of communication open for any potential cooperation against other powers.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that we should continue our joint action against Turkey. However, instead of A SER moving to BUL, which leaves SER undefended, I suggest that A SER holds while A UKR supports A BUD to BUL if you make that move. F RUM will hold its position to prevent any Turkish advances into RUM.

  From GERMANY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact and offering support against France. I believe a joint action against France could be beneficial. However, it might make sense for you to focus on Italy and make sure they do not make a move against you. I will handle the northern front against France. If you need any support against Italy, we could discuss it further.
  From ITALY: Hello Austria, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. The units in Vienna and Trieste are indeed for defensive purposes, and I intend to keep our borders peaceful. However, Turkey seems to be eyeing your centers in Serbia and Greece. I suggest that you focus on defending against potential Turkish threats while we maintain our pact. Let us make sure that our borders remain secure and peaceful.
  From RUSSIA: Thank you for your message. I plan to support your A BUD -> BUL with my A UKR and F RUM can hold or support another strategic move. However, it seems that Italy has captured Vienna which makes them a new threat. We might need to adjust our plans accordingly. What are your thoughts on a joint action against Italy?

  From GERMANY: Thank you for reaffirming the non-aggression pact. France indeed seems to be a growing power and a potential threat to both of us. We need to keep a close watch on France's moves. An alliance against France could be beneficial for both of us. Any moves you make against France would be appreciated. However, I need to make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves against us either. How do you suggest we proceed?
  From ITALY: I confirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Units in VIE and TRI will not make aggressive moves against BUD or SER. Our main focus should indeed be on countering Turkey. How can we coordinate our actions against Turkey? Perhaps you could hold BUD and SER while I support you from VIE and TRI if Turkey makes a move.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that our joint action against Turkey has been effective. I plan to support A SER -> BUL with F RUM. A UKR could also support A BUD -> BUL if that makes sense for us. What specific plans do you have for the next moves against Turkey?

  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. Given your current position, it might be beneficial for us to discuss a potential joint action against Italy or Russia. I propose that you focus on defending against Italy while I handle the threat from France. Let us work together to strengthen our positions.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given your position, would you be interested in a joint action against Turkey? They seem to be a mutual threat.
  From RUSSIA: AUSTRIA, well done on capturing BUL. It seems our joint action against Turkey is progressing well. How should we continue our cooperation? Should we aim for GRE and SER next?

  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I believe mutual support against France and Russia would be beneficial. France currently holds KIE and has a unit in Holland, which is a concern for me. Additionally, Russia's presence in the Baltic region could be a threat to us both. Let us keep each other informed about any significant developments and coordinate if necessary.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. The units in TRI and BOH are primarily for defensive purposes against any potential threats. However, I am open to a joint action against Turkey where you make a specific plan for us to support. Perhaps you could make a move on SER and GRE while I aim for BUD. Let us keep the communication open.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I am pleased that our joint action against Turkey is progressing well. I agree that our next steps should be to aim for Constantinople and Ankara. For the next round, I suggest that you aim for Constantinople while I aim for Ankara. A UKR could support an Austrian move into BUL if necessary, while F RUM could hold to prevent any Turkish counterattacks. Let us continue our successful cooperation.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter 1903 adjustments phase, no new supply centers changed hands. The main activity was likely the building or disbanding of units based on the current supply center counts for each power. France, now holding nine supply centers after acquiring Holland and Spain, may have added a new unit, while Turkey and Austria might have made unit adjustments based on their new supply center totals after their exchange of Greece and Bulgaria."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given the current situation, it seems crucial that we make sure that Russia does not make any aggressive moves towards your borders. How about a joint plan to keep Russia in check?
  From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. Given the current situation, working together against Turkey seems beneficial. If you move A BUD to SER and I support you with F ALB, we could retake Greece. Meanwhile, I could also make a move on Smyrna via F ION -> AEG -> SMY. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, congratulations on your recent gains against Turkey. I would like to reaffirm our joint action against Turkey. It seems that Turkey is now weaker, but we need to make sure they don't recover. Additionally, what are your thoughts on Italy's growing presence in the Balkans? Perhaps a coordinated action could be beneficial for our mutual interests.

  From GERMANY: I agree that France has grown very strong and poses a significant threat to us both. A joint action against France makes sense. However, we need to make sure Russia does not take advantage of our focus on France. Can you provide support against Russia while I focus on the western front? A coordinated attack on France could include us both making moves that put pressure on their supply centers such as BEL, PAR, and HOL.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My units A TRI and A TYR are primarily for defensive purposes and to help us both secure our borders against other potential aggressors. However, I agree that a joint action against Turkey could be mutually beneficial. What specific plans do you have in mind for this year? Perhaps I could support you in retaking Greece while making a move on Smyrna.
  From RUSSIA: I agree to support your A BUL hold with my F RUM. Additionally, my A UKR could support any strategic move you make from BUD to BUL or another location if needed. Let's keep pressuring Turkey together.

  From GERMANY: Austria, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given that Russia has a unit in GAL which borders my unit in WAR, I propose that we work together to counter any Russian aggression. Additionally, if Italy makes any aggressive moves against either of us, we should support each other.
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Given that Turkey has a unit in Bulgaria and a supply center in Greece, a joint action against them could be beneficial for both of us. I propose that my fleet in ION can support your army in BUD to move to SER if you need it while I make a move on Smyrna.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Austria, congratulations on capturing Bulgaria. I want to reaffirm our joint action against Turkey. A UKR could support A BUD to BUL and F RUM could hold. How do you see our current situation?

  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and support your focus on neutralizing Turkey. Once Turkey is dealt with, a joint effort against Russia might be a good next step. However, France has grown too powerful with 8 supply centers and poses a significant threat. Could you help by putting pressure on France from the south, perhaps through Italy? We need to make sure that France does not dominate the board.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My units in VIE and TYR are not intended for aggressive moves against you. They are primarily for defensive purposes and to support our joint action against Turkey. I propose that once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss our next steps. For now, let us focus on a joint action where I could support you in retaking Greece while making a move on Smyrna. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that our joint action against Turkey is making progress. I will support your unit in Bulgaria if it still holds. Let us make a coordinated attack on Constantinople or Ankara. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss our next steps.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: RETREAT / OTHER
CRITICAL: Submit orders appropriate for this phase type (e.g., Retreat or Disband for units needing retreats). Consult rules.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and support your plan to neutralize Turkey first. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against another power such as Italy or France could be beneficial. For now, any immediate support against France would be appreciated if possible.
  From ITALY: I agree that we should focus on Turkey. F ION will move to AEG to attack Smyrna with support from Russia's F RUM. F ALB can support your unit to retake Greece. A VIE could move to BUD if you agree. Let us make a coordinated effort against Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Our joint action against Turkey has been successful so far. For this round, I plan to keep F RUM in place to support any moves you make against Turkey. A GAL could support A BUD to hold or make a move against Turkey if necessary. Let us continue to press until Turkey is neutralized.

Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. The main mutual threat appears to be France, which now has 8 supply centers. Once you have neutralized Turkey, it might be beneficial for us to jointly address the French threat. For now, I plan to keep an eye on Italy's unit in BOH. Any updates on your front?
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. My units in VIE and TRI are primarily for defensive purposes and to support any joint action against Turkey. I propose a coordinated attack on Turkey where my F ALB could support your unit in retaking Greece while my F AEG could make a move to support an attack on Smyrna. Additionally, I could support you in retaking Serbia if necessary. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that we should keep up the pressure on Turkey. F RUM will support A SER hold against any Turkish attacks from BUL. A GAL could support A BUD hold or make a move against Turkey if A BUL moves out of BUL. Let us make sure that Turkey is neutralized so that we can turn our attention to other threats such as France.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 moves phase, there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in Fall 1904, where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria, thus resulting in a swap of these two supply centers between the two powers, persisted through this phase. The lack of center changes indicates that no new captures or significant territorial shifts occurred during this phase.}

Phase: S1905R, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 moves phase, there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in Fall 1904, where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria, thus resulting in a swap of these two supply centers between the two powers, persisted through this phase. The lack of center changes indicates that no new captures or significant territorial shifts occurred during this phase.}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1905R
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A BUD, F CON, A BUL
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "BUD"], ["F", "CON"], ["A", "BUL"]], "ENGLAND": [["F", "NTH"], ["F", "SKA"], ["F", "BEL"], ["A", "LON"]], "FRANCE": [["F", "GAS"], ["F", "BRE"], ["A", "HOL"], ["A", "PAR"], ["F", "MAR"], ["A", "SPA"], ["F", "MAO"]], "GERMANY": [["F", "SWE"], ["A", "WAR"], ["A", "BUR"], ["A", "RUH"]], "ITALY": [["A", "ROM"], ["A", "BOH"], ["A", "TYR"], ["A", "VIE"], ["F", "AEG"], ["F", "GRE"]], "RUSSIA": [["F", "RUM"], ["A", "STP"], ["A", "MOS"], ["A", "GAL"]], "TURKEY": [["F", "BLA"], ["A", "SMY"], ["*A", "CON"]]}
  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "SER", "SMY"], "ENGLAND": ["EDI", "LON", "LVP", "NWY"], "FRANCE": ["BEL", "BRE", "HOL", "KIE", "MAR", "PAR", "POR", "SPA"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "MUN", "SWE", "WAR"], "ITALY": ["NAP", "ROM", "TRI", "TUN", "VEN", "VIE"], "RUSSIA": ["MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "STP"], "TURKEY": ["ANK", "BUL", "CON", "GRE"]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I hope we can continue to focus on our respective goals and avoid any conflicts.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. To address the Turkish threat, I propose a joint action where Italy aims to capture Smyrna while supporting your efforts in retaking Greece and possibly Serbia. Let us plan a coordinated attack against Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Austria, I hope our joint action against Turkey still holds. I need to make sure that your unit in BUL does not make any aggressive moves against RUM. Let us make a coordinated attack on Constantinople or Ankara.
