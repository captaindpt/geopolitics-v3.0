  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I hope we can confirm our non-aggression pact. Let us avoid conflict in the Adriatic area so that you can focus on the Balkans and potentially against Russia while I focus on the Mediterranean. What are your plans for this round?
  From RUSSIA: I am still committed to our joint action against Turkey where you aim for Greece and Serbia while I aim for Bulgaria and Rumania. However, Turkey has a fleet in BLA and an army in BUL, so we need to coordinate our moves carefully. What are your plans for this round?

  From GERMANY: Thank you for agreeing to a non-aggression pact. Given that we both face threats from Russia and potentially Italy, it makes sense for us to support each other if one of us is attacked. For now, I plan to make no aggressive moves against you and hope you will do the same.
  From ITALY: Hello, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given our mutual interests in the Balkans, would you be interested in a coordinated action against Turkey? Perhaps we could discuss a plan where we both make moves that could help us gain more supply centers in the region.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Austria, it seems that our joint action against Turkey has been successful for you so far. I hope we can continue to work together to keep Turkey in check. What are your plans for this round?

  From ITALY: Hello, thank you for reaching out. Our non-aggression pact stands firm. A TYR is primarily for defensive purposes and to make sure our borders are secure. It might also be used to support action against another power such as Turkey if there is mutual agreement. However, I need to make sure our borders are safe from any potential threats. Could you provide details on your plans for your units in Trieste and Serbia?
  From RUSSIA: I agree that we should continue our joint action against Turkey. I plan to support your moves against Turkey where possible. For this round, I suggest that A GAL could support your A BUD to hold its position if necessary or make a move on BUL if you support it. F RUM could support an Austrian move into BUL or hold its position to prevent Turkish advances. Let us make sure that our borders remain secure while we make gains against Turkey.

  From GERMANY: Hello Austria. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Currently, I need to address some issues with France and Russia. The French unit in KIE is a major concern for us. I am also trying to clarify a dispute with Russia over Sweden. Any support or coordination against Russia would be welcome.
  From ITALY: Hello, thank you for the update. Our non-aggression pact is indeed holding. Currently, I do not have a fleet in the Ionian Sea (F ION) to support any action against Turkey. However, once I establish a fleet there, I am open to discussing such coordinated actions. Let us keep up the good work.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Austria, it seems that our joint action against Turkey did not result in any new supply center changes, largely due to defensive actions by Turkey and Italy's intervention in the Balkans. However, let us reaffirm our alliance against Turkey and make a new plan for the next year where you aim for Greece and Serbia while I aim for Bulgaria and Rumania. Let us make a coordinated effort in Spring 1903.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, our non-aggression pact still stands. Our main focus is on defensive and strategic positioning for A VIE and A TRI. We need to make sure that these units are well-positioned against any potential threats. However, there is no intention for an immediate attack on your units unless provoked. Let us keep our lines of communication open for any potential cooperation against other powers.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that we should continue our joint action against Turkey. However, instead of A SER moving to BUL, which leaves SER undefended, I suggest that A SER holds while A UKR supports A BUD to BUL if you make that move. F RUM will hold its position to prevent any Turkish advances into RUM.

  From GERMANY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact and offering support against France. I believe a joint action against France could be beneficial. However, it might make sense for you to focus on Italy and make sure they do not make a move against you. I will handle the northern front against France. If you need any support against Italy, we could discuss it further.
  From ITALY: Hello Austria, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. The units in Vienna and Trieste are indeed for defensive purposes, and I intend to keep our borders peaceful. However, Turkey seems to be eyeing your centers in Serbia and Greece. I suggest that you focus on defending against potential Turkish threats while we maintain our pact. Let us make sure that our borders remain secure and peaceful.
  From RUSSIA: Thank you for your message. I plan to support your A BUD -> BUL with my A UKR and F RUM can hold or support another strategic move. However, it seems that Italy has captured Vienna which makes them a new threat. We might need to adjust our plans accordingly. What are your thoughts on a joint action against Italy?

  From GERMANY: Thank you for reaffirming the non-aggression pact. France indeed seems to be a growing power and a potential threat to both of us. We need to keep a close watch on France's moves. An alliance against France could be beneficial for both of us. Any moves you make against France would be appreciated. However, I need to make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves against us either. How do you suggest we proceed?
  From ITALY: I confirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Units in VIE and TRI will not make aggressive moves against BUD or SER. Our main focus should indeed be on countering Turkey. How can we coordinate our actions against Turkey? Perhaps you could hold BUD and SER while I support you from VIE and TRI if Turkey makes a move.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that our joint action against Turkey has been effective. I plan to support A SER -> BUL with F RUM. A UKR could also support A BUD -> BUL if that makes sense for us. What specific plans do you have for the next moves against Turkey?

  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. Given your current position, it might be beneficial for us to discuss a potential joint action against Italy or Russia. I propose that you focus on defending against Italy while I handle the threat from France. Let us work together to strengthen our positions.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given your position, would you be interested in a joint action against Turkey? They seem to be a mutual threat.
  From RUSSIA: AUSTRIA, well done on capturing BUL. It seems our joint action against Turkey is progressing well. How should we continue our cooperation? Should we aim for GRE and SER next?

  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I believe mutual support against France and Russia would be beneficial. France currently holds KIE and has a unit in Holland, which is a concern for me. Additionally, Russia's presence in the Baltic region could be a threat to us both. Let us keep each other informed about any significant developments and coordinate if necessary.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. The units in TRI and BOH are primarily for defensive purposes against any potential threats. However, I am open to a joint action against Turkey where you make a specific plan for us to support. Perhaps you could make a move on SER and GRE while I aim for BUD. Let us keep the communication open.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I am pleased that our joint action against Turkey is progressing well. I agree that our next steps should be to aim for Constantinople and Ankara. For the next round, I suggest that you aim for Constantinople while I aim for Ankara. A UKR could support an Austrian move into BUL if necessary, while F RUM could hold to prevent any Turkish counterattacks. Let us continue our successful cooperation.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter 1903 adjustments phase, no new supply centers changed hands. The main activity was likely the building or disbanding of units based on the current supply center counts for each power. France, now holding nine supply centers after acquiring Holland and Spain, may have added a new unit, while Turkey and Austria might have made unit adjustments based on their new supply center totals after their exchange of Greece and Bulgaria."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given the current situation, it seems crucial that we make sure that Russia does not make any aggressive moves towards your borders. How about a joint plan to keep Russia in check?
  From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. Given the current situation, working together against Turkey seems beneficial. If you move A BUD to SER and I support you with F ALB, we could retake Greece. Meanwhile, I could also make a move on Smyrna via F ION -> AEG -> SMY. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, congratulations on your recent gains against Turkey. I would like to reaffirm our joint action against Turkey. It seems that Turkey is now weaker, but we need to make sure they don't recover. Additionally, what are your thoughts on Italy's growing presence in the Balkans? Perhaps a coordinated action could be beneficial for our mutual interests.

  From GERMANY: I agree that France has grown very strong and poses a significant threat to us both. A joint action against France makes sense. However, we need to make sure Russia does not take advantage of our focus on France. Can you provide support against Russia while I focus on the western front? A coordinated attack on France could include us both making moves that put pressure on their supply centers such as BEL, PAR, and HOL.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My units A TRI and A TYR are primarily for defensive purposes and to help us both secure our borders against other potential aggressors. However, I agree that a joint action against Turkey could be mutually beneficial. What specific plans do you have in mind for this year? Perhaps I could support you in retaking Greece while making a move on Smyrna.
  From RUSSIA: I agree to support your A BUL hold with my F RUM. Additionally, my A UKR could support any strategic move you make from BUD to BUL or another location if needed. Let's keep pressuring Turkey together.

  From GERMANY: Austria, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given that Russia has a unit in GAL which borders my unit in WAR, I propose that we work together to counter any Russian aggression. Additionally, if Italy makes any aggressive moves against either of us, we should support each other.
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. Given that Turkey has a unit in Bulgaria and a supply center in Greece, a joint action against them could be beneficial for both of us. I propose that my fleet in ION can support your army in BUD to move to SER if you need it while I make a move on Smyrna.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Austria, congratulations on capturing Bulgaria. I want to reaffirm our joint action against Turkey. A UKR could support A BUD to BUL and F RUM could hold. How do you see our current situation?

  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and support your focus on neutralizing Turkey. Once Turkey is dealt with, a joint effort against Russia might be a good next step. However, France has grown too powerful with 8 supply centers and poses a significant threat. Could you help by putting pressure on France from the south, perhaps through Italy? We need to make sure that France does not dominate the board.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My units in VIE and TYR are not intended for aggressive moves against you. They are primarily for defensive purposes and to support our joint action against Turkey. I propose that once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss our next steps. For now, let us focus on a joint action where I could support you in retaking Greece while making a move on Smyrna. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that our joint action against Turkey is making progress. I will support your unit in Bulgaria if it still holds. Let us make a coordinated attack on Constantinople or Ankara. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss our next steps.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: RETREAT / OTHER
CRITICAL: Submit orders appropriate for this phase type (e.g., Retreat or Disband for units needing retreats). Consult rules.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and support your plan to neutralize Turkey first. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against another power such as Italy or France could be beneficial. For now, any immediate support against France would be appreciated if possible.
  From ITALY: I agree that we should focus on Turkey. F ION will move to AEG to attack Smyrna with support from Russia's F RUM. F ALB can support your unit to retake Greece. A VIE could move to BUD if you agree. Let us make a coordinated effort against Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Our joint action against Turkey has been successful so far. For this round, I plan to keep F RUM in place to support any moves you make against Turkey. A GAL could support A BUD to hold or make a move against Turkey if necessary. Let us continue to press until Turkey is neutralized.

Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. The main mutual threat appears to be France, which now has 8 supply centers. Once you have neutralized Turkey, it might be beneficial for us to jointly address the French threat. For now, I plan to keep an eye on Italy's unit in BOH. Any updates on your front?
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. My units in VIE and TRI are primarily for defensive purposes and to support any joint action against Turkey. I propose a coordinated attack on Turkey where my F ALB could support your unit in retaking Greece while my F AEG could make a move to support an attack on Smyrna. Additionally, I could support you in retaking Serbia if necessary. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that we should keep up the pressure on Turkey. F RUM will support A SER hold against any Turkish attacks from BUL. A GAL could support A BUD hold or make a move against Turkey if A BUL moves out of BUL. Let us make sure that Turkey is neutralized so that we can turn our attention to other threats such as France.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 moves phase, there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in Fall 1904, where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria, thus resulting in a swap of these two supply centers between the two powers, persisted through this phase. The lack of center changes indicates that no new captures or significant territorial shifts occurred during this phase.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 moves phase, there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in Fall 1904, where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria, thus resulting in a swap of these two supply centers between the two powers, persisted through this phase. The lack of center changes indicates that no new captures or significant territorial shifts occurred during this phase.}

  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I hope we can continue to focus on our respective goals and avoid any conflicts.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. To address the Turkish threat, I propose a joint action where Italy aims to capture Smyrna while supporting your efforts in retaking Greece and possibly Serbia. Let us plan a coordinated attack against Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Austria, I hope our joint action against Turkey still holds. I need to make sure that your unit in BUL does not make any aggressive moves against RUM. Let us make a coordinated attack on Constantinople or Ankara.

  From GERMANY: Our non-aggression pact has indeed been crucial for our stability. Once Turkey is neutralized, it makes sense to discuss potential threats from France or Italy. Currently, France seems to be the main threat on the board with 8 supply centers. My plans for A BUR and A RUH are primarily defensive against any potential French aggression. However, once Turkey is neutralized, we should indeed discuss our next steps.
  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905 has indeed been beneficial. A VIE and A TYR are primarily for defensive purposes and to support any joint action against Turkey. I propose a coordinated attack where I aim for Smyrna while supporting you in retaking Greece and possibly Serbia. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, our joint action against Turkey has indeed been successful. I agree that we should continue until Turkey is neutralized. For F RUM, I plan to hold or support a move against BUL if necessary, while A GAL could either support an attack on BUD or assist in any other strategic moves you might need. However, we need to be cautious of France, who has become the dominant power with 8 supply centers. It might be wise to make sure that once Turkey is neutralized, we need to make a coordinated effort against France.

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 retreats phase (S1905R), there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in the Spring 1905 moves phase remained the same, indicating that no units were dislodged or required retreats. The game state thus continues to reflect the territorial changes from the Fall 1904 phase where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria.}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. Given the current situation, I propose that you move A BUD to GAL to support a potential German move from WAR to MOS or to defend against a potential Russian move from GAL to BUD.
  From ITALY: Let us continue our joint action against Turkey. I aim for Smyrna while supporting you in retaking Greece and possibly Serbia. How should we coordinate our moves this round?
  From RUSSIA: Our joint action against Turkey seems to be making progress. What are your plans for the next round? Do you intend to hold BUL and CON, or should we work together to weaken Turkey further?

  From GERMANY: Hello, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I support your plan to neutralize Turkey. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, a joint action against France might be a good next step as they currently hold 8 supply centers and are a significant threat. Let us keep in close communication.
  From ITALY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. To address your proposal, I suggest that my F AEG should support your F CON to hold or make a move against Ankara. However, I need to make a move on Smyrna. Therefore, I plan to have F GRE make a move to support your A BUL against Constantinople if necessary. Let us make a coordinated move against Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: I agree to continue our joint action against Turkey until they are neutralized. A GAL will support A BUL to hold or make a move against Constantinople if necessary. F RUM could make a move to support A BUL or make a move against BLA. Let us make a coordinated effort to push Turkey out of the Balkans.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

  From GERMANY: Hi, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact as well. My main focus now is on France who has become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. How are your efforts against Turkey progressing?
  From ITALY: Thank you for your message. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. However, I need to clarify that I do not have a unit in Vienna (VIE), only in Trieste (TRI). However, I do own Vienna as a supply center. I agree that our focus should remain on Turkey. I propose a coordinated action where my F AEG supports your moves against the Black Sea (BLA) or Smyrna (SMY) if necessary. I aim to capture Smyrna while supporting you in retaking Greece (GRE) and possibly Serbia (SER) if necessary. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: I agree that we need to make a decisive move against Turkey. I can support A BUL hold with A GAL and make a move towards Ankara with A UKR. However, it is important that we make sure that France does not become too dominant. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a coordinated action against France.

\boxed{During the Winter 1905 adjustment phase (W1905A), no supply centers changed ownership. Based on the previous phase, Germany, England, Austria, and Italy were able to build one unit each due to each gaining a new supply center. Conversely, France had to disband two units due to losing Holland and Kiel, while Turkey needed to disband one unit after a net loss of one supply center.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Winter 1905 adjustment phase (W1905A), no supply centers changed ownership. Based on the previous phase, Germany, England, Austria, and Italy were able to build one unit each due to each gaining a new supply center. Conversely, France had to disband two units due to losing Holland and Kiel, while Turkey needed to disband one unit after a net loss of one supply center.}

  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Let us continue to support each other against any threats from other powers such as Russia. How do you see our cooperation evolving this round?
  From ITALY: Greetings, Austria. Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905 has expired. I propose that we extend this pact until the end of 1906. Additionally, I suggest we continue our joint action against Turkey. I aim to take Smyrna while supporting you in retaking Greece and possibly Serbia. What are your thoughts on this plan for this year?
  From RUSSIA: Austria, let us reaffirm our joint action against Turkey. It seems that Turkey is in a weak position with only 2 supply centers. We should make a coordinated move to eliminate Turkey from the game.

  From ITALY: I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. I understand your concerns about my units in TRI, BOH, and TYR. They are primarily for defensive purposes and to support actions against Turkey and Germany if necessary. I propose a joint action against Turkey where I aim for Smyrna while supporting you in retaking Greece and possibly Serbia.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that our joint action against Turkey has been successful. I plan to continue our coordinated efforts until Turkey is completely neutralized. Once Turkey is no longer a threat, I propose that we make a non-aggression pact and focus on other potential threats such as Germany or Italy. My units in RUM and GAL will primarily be used to support our joint action against Turkey until that point.

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1906 movement phase (S1906M), no supply centers changed ownership, thus maintaining the status quo in terms of territorial gains and losses for all powers involved. The distribution of supply centers remained the same as at the end of the Winter 1905 adjustment phase, where Germany, England, Austria, and Italy had each gained a new supply center previously, while France had lost two centers and Turkey had lost one. The round of military maneuvers did not result in any new captures or losses for any power.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1906 movement phase (S1906M), no supply centers changed ownership, thus maintaining the status quo in terms of territorial gains and losses for all powers involved. The distribution of supply centers remained the same as at the end of the Winter 1905 adjustment phase, where Germany, England, Austria, and Italy had each gained a new supply center previously, while France had lost two centers and Turkey had lost one. The round of military maneuvers did not result in any new captures or losses for any power.}

  From FRANCE: We hope our relations remain amicable. Currently, our main focus is on Germany. Any support you could provide against Germany would be appreciated.
  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. If there are any joint actions you would like to take against Italy or Russia, please let me know. We need to make sure that our borders remain secure.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I propose that we continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. Additionally, I suggest that we work together to eliminate Turkey. I aim to capture Smyrna while supporting you in retaking Greece and possibly Serbia. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I want to reaffirm our joint action against Turkey until Turkey is neutralized. Once Turkey is out, I propose a non-aggression pact between us. For now, let us make sure that we make coordinated moves against Turkey.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Winter 1906 adjustments phase (W1906A) saw no changes in the ownership of supply centers. The results from the Fall 1906 movement phase thus remained in effect, where England gained Belgium from France, Turkey reclaimed Constantinople from Austria while losing Smyrna to Italy, and Italy captured Smyrna from Turkey and Serbia from Austria. Consequently, England's total supply centers increased by one, Italy gained two new centers, Turkey had a net gain of one center, while France lost one center and Austria lost two centers.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Winter 1906 adjustments phase (W1906A) saw no changes in the ownership of supply centers. The results from the Fall 1906 movement phase thus remained in effect, where England gained Belgium from France, Turkey reclaimed Constantinople from Austria while losing Smyrna to Italy, and Italy captured Smyrna from Turkey and Serbia from Austria. Consequently, England's total supply centers increased by one, Italy gained two new centers, Turkey had a net gain of one center, while France lost one center and Austria lost two centers.}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From GERMANY: Hello, Austria. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given that you only have two supply centers left, it seems that Italy is a significant threat to you. How can we support each other against potential threats from Italy or other powers?
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. I propose a joint action against Turkey where I aim to keep Smyrna while supporting you in retaking Greece and possibly Serbia. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Turkey. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a plan against Italy who is becoming too powerful.

  From GERMANY: To AUSTRIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given Italy's significant power now, it makes sense for us to make a plan against them. However, any such plan should be well-coordinated and might require us to also involve Russia and England. Do you have any specific plans in mind?
  From ITALY: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. Given the mutual threat posed by Turkey, I suggest a joint action where I maintain control of Smyrna while supporting you in retaking Bulgaria. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: I agree that Italy has become a significant threat. However, it makes sense for us to first make sure that Turkey is completely eliminated. Once that is done, a joint action against Italy could be highly beneficial for both of us.
  From TURKEY: I agree that a temporary truce could be beneficial for both of us given our current situation. Italy seems to be a common threat. Let us make a plan to focus on regaining some lost ground from Italy. What specific actions do you propose for us to make a coordinated effort against Italy?

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Spring 1907 movement phase (S1907M) followed a Winter 1906 adjustments phase that saw no changes in supply center ownership. However, during the Fall 1906 phase, England had captured Belgium from France, Italy had taken Smyrna from Turkey and Serbia from Austria, while Turkey had reclaimed Constantinople from Austria. This resulted in England gaining one additional supply center, Italy gaining two, Turkey having a net gain of one, while France lost one and Austria lost two supply centers. The Spring 1907 movement phase itself did not result in any changes in ownership of supply centers, so the distribution of supply centers remained as it was after the Winter 1906 adjustments phase.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Spring 1907 movement phase (S1907M) followed a Winter 1906 adjustments phase that saw no changes in supply center ownership. However, during the Fall 1906 phase, England had captured Belgium from France, Italy had taken Smyrna from Turkey and Serbia from Austria, while Turkey had reclaimed Constantinople from Austria. This resulted in England gaining one additional supply center, Italy gaining two, Turkey having a net gain of one, while France lost one and Austria lost two supply centers. The Spring 1907 movement phase itself did not result in any changes in ownership of supply centers, so the distribution of supply centers remained as it was after the Winter 1906 adjustments phase.}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From GERMANY: Hello Austria, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given Italy's strong position, do you need any support from us? We should make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves against us.
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. I propose a joint action against Turkey where you could aim for Bulgaria while I support from Smyrna and the Aegean Sea.
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Turkey. I propose that A SEV should move to ANK supported by F RUM if necessary. Once Turkey is neutralized, we need to address Italy's growing power. What are your thoughts on a joint action against Italy once Turkey is out?
  From TURKEY: Hello Austria, it seems that Italy is a significant threat to both of us. We had a temporary truce in the last round. Would you be interested in continuing this cooperation against Italy? Perhaps we could coordinate our actions such as your unit in BUL supporting my unit in CON if Italy makes a move on it.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact remains in place until the end of 1907. Our joint action against Turkey seems to be making progress. I plan to keep supporting your efforts to retake Greece and possibly Serbia once Turkey is pushed back.
  From RUSSIA: Hello, Austria. Given that you have only one supply center, I propose a joint action against Italy and Turkey. We need to make a coordinated effort to check their growing power and help you regain some centers. What are your thoughts on this?
  From TURKEY: To Austria, it appears that Italy has become a dominant power and poses a threat to both of us. This might be a good time for us to form an alliance against Italy. What do you think about a coordinated effort to weaken Italy's hold on the Balkans?

  From GERMANY: I agree that Italy is a growing threat and a joint action against them makes sense once Turkey is neutralized. However, Italy has a stronger position currently. We need to make a solid plan once Turkey is no longer a threat to you. Let us keep our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 and prepare for a joint action against Italy soon.
  From ITALY: Hello Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. I assure you that I have no aggressive intentions against BUD or BUL. My main focus is on resolving the situation with Turkey. Once that is done, we can discuss our next steps together. What are your plans for the next phase?
  From RUSSIA: Hello Austria, I agree that our joint action against Turkey should continue until they are neutralized. Once that is done, I am open to a joint action against Italy. How do you propose we make a coordinated attack against Italy once Turkey is no longer a threat?
  From TURKEY: Hello Austria, I am open to a truce or an alliance against Italy. Given that Italy holds a significant number of supply centers, a coordinated effort could help us both. However, I need to make sure that my main goal is to recapture Smyrna. If you are willing to support me on that, I am open to coordinating our actions against Italy.

  From GERMANY: Austria, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. Additionally, once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss a joint plan against Italy if that makes sense given the current board state.
  From ITALY: I propose that we extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. Additionally, let us continue our joint action against Turkey where you should aim to retake Bulgaria and possibly Serbia while I aim for Smyrna. I am open to supporting you in retaking Greece if needed.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, we need to make a joint action against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out of the picture, we should plan a joint action against Italy. How do you feel about this?
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, our temporary truce and potential alliance against Italy seems to be a strategic necessity. I propose that we make a joint plan against Italy's units in the Balkans. What are your thoughts on a coordinated action against Italy?

  From GERMANY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. Regarding Italy's unit in BOH, I am willing to support an Austrian move into BOH if you make that move. However, I need assurance that your focus is primarily against Italy.
  From ITALY: Hello Austria. Yes, let us extend the non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. The A BOH unit is primarily for defensive purposes and to protect our mutual interests against potential threats such as Germany. However, given that Turkey seems like a common threat for us, a joint action against Turkey might be beneficial. I can support your efforts to retake Bulgaria or Greece if you need assistance.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that Italy is a significant threat. A GAL can support an Austrian move into BOH or VIE if it makes strategic sense. Let us make a coordinated plan against Italy.
  From TURKEY: Hello Austria, I am open to a temporary truce and a joint action against Italy. However, I need assurance that you will not make any moves against my units or centers while we focus on Italy. Given that Italy holds a unit in GRE, I could make a move against it. However, I need your support in making sure that we both make a coordinated effort here. Could you make a move against Italy in VIE or BOH?

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

  From ITALY: Let us continue our joint action against Turkey. I aim for Smyrna while supporting you in retaking Bulgaria and possibly Serbia. How can we best coordinate our moves this round?
  From RUSSIA: Let us continue our joint action against Italy. A GAL could support an Austrian move into BOH or VIE. What is your plan for this round?
  From TURKEY: Hello. Given our truce and the current situation, do you see any potential for a joint action against Italy? They seem to be a growing power with a significant number of supply centers. Perhaps we could make a coordinated effort to weaken them.

  From GERMANY: I agree that Italy is a growing threat. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to a joint plan against Italy. For now, let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. What specific actions should we take against Italy once we are ready?
  From ITALY: Hello, I am reaffirming our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. I have no aggressive intentions towards BUD or SER. My main focus is on Turkey. I am open to supporting you in retaking BUL if necessary. Let us continue to cooperate against Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Hello, I agree that Turkey is in a weak position and it makes sense to start focusing on Italy. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy should be a priority. I propose that you make a move on VIE or BOH while I support from GAL or make a move on WAR to put pressure on Germany if necessary. Let us make a coordinated effort against Italy.
  From TURKEY: I agree that Italy is a growing threat and a joint action against them could be beneficial for both of us. However, we need a well-coordinated plan. What specific actions do you propose? I am open to a temporary truce and a joint action against Italy.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):

Another important point is that Bulgaria needs a unit to make sure that we keep that supply center until the end of the year. Hence, a plan could be:
1. A BUD - VIE (aim to recapture Vienna from Italy).
2. A SER - BUL (make sure that Bulgaria remains under our control until the end of the year). Another plan could be:
1. A BUD - VIE.
2. A SER S A BUD - VIE. However, this might leave Bulgaria unoccupied. Another conservative plan could be:
1. A BUD - VIE (if that fails, BUD is still defended).
2. A SER H (defend Serbia). However, a unit should be in Bulgaria to make sure we keep that supply center. Thus, another option could be:
1. A BUD - TRI (which puts pressure on another Italian supply center).

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Fall of 1908, no supply centers changed ownership. Thus, the distribution of supply centers remains the same as it was at the end of the Spring of 1908, which was identical to the distribution at the end of the Winter of 1907. Thus, Turkey still holds 4 supply centers, Austria has 2 supply centers, and Italy retains 5 supply centers. The phase did not result in any significant changes to the current state of the game, and thus the game continues."}

Phase: F1908R, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Fall of 1908, no supply centers changed ownership. Thus, the distribution of supply centers remains the same as it was at the end of the Spring of 1908, which was identical to the distribution at the end of the Winter of 1907. Thus, Turkey still holds 4 supply centers, Austria has 2 supply centers, and Italy retains 5 supply centers. The phase did not result in any significant changes to the current state of the game, and thus the game continues."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. Let us continue to work together against any common threats. Do you need any help against Italy or any other power?
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I hope our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908 still stands. Our joint action against Turkey should continue next year. Let us plan for 1909 to make a coordinated effort against Turkey. What are your thoughts on retaking BUL?
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a joint action against Italy where A GAL could support an Austrian move into BOH or VIE.
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, our truce has been beneficial thus far. Given that Italy has a strong presence in the region, I propose that we continue our joint action against Italy once the non-aggression pact with Italy expires at the end of 1908. What are your thoughts on this plan?

  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I can assure you that I have no aggressive intentions towards BUD or SER until the end of 1908. Once Turkey is neutralized, I believe it would be beneficial for us to reassess the situation and discuss future plans such as a potential joint action against another power like Germany or France. Let us continue our joint action against Turkey until the end of 1908.
  From RUSSIA: Let us continue our joint action against Turkey until they are neutralized. Once that is done, we need to plan a joint action against Italy. I can support an Austrian move into BOH with A GAL if necessary once Turkey is neutralized.
  From TURKEY: I reaffirm our temporary truce until the end of 1908. Once Turkey is no longer a significant threat, a joint action against Italy could be beneficial. I assure you that Turkey will not make any aggressive moves against BUD or SER until the end of 1908.

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter of 1908 Adjustment phase, Turkey was eligible to build one new unit due to their increased total of 5 supply centers. Austria, now holding only one supply center, had to disband one of their units. Italy maintained their 5 supply centers and thus likely made no unit adjustments. No supply centers changed hands during this phase."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From GERMANY: Greetings, given that our non-aggression pact was until the end of 1908, would you be interested in extending it for the year 1909? Additionally, what are your plans for this round?
  From ITALY: Let us renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Given that Turkey still holds several key supply centers such as ANK, BUL, CON, and SMY, a coordinated attack could be very beneficial for us. How about we plan an attack where you move towards Bulgaria while I support your efforts from the Aegean Sea? Once Turkey is weakened, we can work together to secure the Balkans.
  From RUSSIA: We need to make a joint action against Italy who now holds 7 supply centers. A GAL can support any move you make against Italy. What is your plan for this round?
  From TURKEY: Hello. Despite previous conflicts, our truce has helped us both. Now that our non-aggression pact with Italy might be expiring, it could be a good opportunity for us to make a joint action against Italy if you are still interested. What are your thoughts on a potential alliance against Italy?

  From GERMANY: Austria, I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Given Italy's growing power, it makes sense for us to work together. I plan to make a defensive move such as keeping A BOH where it is or moving it towards VIE if that makes strategic sense.
  From ITALY: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. My intentions for BUD and SER are non-aggressive; I aim to support your efforts in BUL while focusing on neutralizing Turkey. We should continue our joint action against Turkey until the situation is resolved.
  From RUSSIA: Austria, I agree that Italy is a significant threat. However, a coordinated action against Italy makes sense once Turkey is further weakened. For now, my A GAL can support any strategic moves you make against Italy. However, our main priority should be to make sure Turkey does not regain strength. Do you have a specific plan for a joint action this round?
  From TURKEY: I agree that Italy is a significant threat and a joint action against them makes sense. Let us coordinate our moves carefully so that we can make meaningful progress against Italy. Given your current position, what specific actions do you propose?

  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. I propose a joint action against Turkey where I aim for Smyrna while supporting you in retaking Bulgaria and possibly Serbia. How do you plan to proceed this round?
  From RUSSIA: Austria, I reaffirm our joint action against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out of the picture, I believe we should make a joint action against Italy. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, our truce has been beneficial for both of us. Given that Italy is a common threat, I propose that we discuss a potential joint action against Italy once the non-aggression pact with them expires at the end of 1909. What are your thoughts on this?

  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Once Turkey is neutralized, I am open to a joint action against Italy. I can apply pressure on BOH or VIE if necessary. Let us keep in touch for a coordinated plan.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. I have no aggressive intentions towards BUD or SER. To retake Bulgaria, I propose that my F GRE supports your A SER to BUL while I can also support your move from BUD to SER if necessary. Once Bulgaria is secured, we should make a joint push against Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Yes, once Turkey is neutralized, I can provide specific support such as A GAL supporting an Austrian move into BOH or VIE. However, for now, we should focus on neutralizing Turkey so that we can make a solid action against Italy together.
  From TURKEY: We accept your offer for a temporary truce and a joint action against Italy. We assure you that we have no intention of making aggressive moves against BUD or SER until Italy is a significant threat. Let us focus on weakening Italy first.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: RETREAT / OTHER
CRITICAL: Submit orders appropriate for this phase type (e.g., Retreat or Disband for units needing retreats). Consult rules.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From GERMANY: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Once the pact expires, a coordinated effort against Italy makes sense given their dominance. We could support you in an attack on VEN or TRI once the non-aggression pact expires. What are your thoughts on a joint plan for after 1909?
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. For retaking Bulgaria, I suggest you move A SER to BUL. I can support you with F GRE if necessary. Another option could be for you to move A BUD to BUL if A SER needs to stay in place for defense. Let us coordinate our moves carefully.
  From RUSSIA: We need to continue our joint action against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once that is done, we should make a joint effort against Italy. I plan to make a move against Turkey's units such as A BUL or A CON. Once Turkey is neutralized, my A GAL can support any strategic moves you make against Italy.
  From TURKEY: I agree to keep the temporary truce until the end of 1909. Once the non-aggression pact with Italy expires, I am interested in a joint action against Italy where I aim for the region of Greece (GRE) and possibly the Aegean Sea (AEG) to secure my western borders. It makes sense for us to coordinate our actions closely against a common enemy.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json

  From GERMANY: Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909 has expired. Are you interested in renewing it until the end of 1910? We need to make sure that our alliance stays strong.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I am glad to see that you successfully captured Bulgaria from Turkey. Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909 still stands. I would like to propose a joint action against Turkey where we aim for Smyrna while supporting you if you need any help in retaking Greece or Serbia if necessary. Once Turkey is dealt with, we could explore further strategic moves together.
  From RUSSIA: Congratulations on capturing Bulgaria from Turkey. Let us continue to keep up the pressure on Turkey until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out, I propose that we make a joint action against Italy due to their growing power.
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, your capture of BUL in the last round has made our truce seem less reliable. However, I am still open to a truce or an alliance against Italy if you are still interested. What are your intentions for this round?

  From GERMANY: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. However, once that pact expires, a joint action against Italy seems wise given their current strength. I am open to pressuring BOH or VIE once the pact with Italy expires. Let us plan a coordinated effort for the future.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. Given that we have successfully weakened Turkey by capturing Bulgaria, I propose that we continue our collaboration until Turkey is completely neutralized. I aim for Smyrna while you could focus on holding Bulgaria and possibly making a move on Constantinople or Ankara. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, we should turn our attention to Italy. Your suggestion for A GAL supporting moves into BOH or VIE makes sense. However, our first priority should be to ensure Turkey is completely neutralized. Let us make a final push to eliminate Turkey and then make a coordinated move against Italy. What do you think about a joint action against Turkey where we aim for Ankara while you continue to hold Bulgaria?
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, I accept your proposal for a temporary truce until I am in a more stable situation. However, I need some time to recover and consolidate. Once I am in a stable situation, I am open to discussing a joint action against Italy. For now, let us maintain peace on our borders.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From GERMANY: To Austria, let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. Given that Austria still holds Bulgaria and the situation seems stable, a joint action against Italy could be beneficial for us both. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan against Italy?
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. It seems that a joint action against Turkey should be our main focus this round. I aim for Smyrna while you aim to retake Bulgaria. If possible, a joint move on Constantinople or Ankara could be beneficial. What are your thoughts?
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out of the picture, we should make a joint action against Italy. A GAL can support any strategic moves against Italy once Turkey is further weakened.
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, I need to understand your intentions given that you hold Bulgaria, which was once part of my supply centers. We need to make a new agreement. Are you open to a joint action against Italy where you might gain something else in exchange for withdrawing from Bulgaria?

  From GERMANY: Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. Once Turkey is neutralized, I agree that a joint action against Italy would be beneficial. My units in BUR and TYR could indeed be used to pressure Italy from the west. Let's stay in close contact.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. I assure you that I have no aggressive intentions against BUD or SER. Our joint action against Turkey should indeed continue until it is neutralized. Let us plan our moves to make sure Turkey is effectively countered.
  From RUSSIA: Austria, I agree that our joint action against Turkey should continue until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out of the picture, I am ready to coordinate a joint action against Italy where my unit in GAL could support an Austrian move into BOH or VIE. Let us make a final push against Turkey this round.
  From TURKEY: I agree that our temporary truce should hold until I stabilize. I assure you that I will not make any aggressive moves against BUL or SER until that time. However, our stabilization might include an attempt to regain BUL eventually. For now, I need to ensure that our truce holds firmly against any external threats.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

  From GERMANY: Hello. Given our previous non-aggression pact until the end of 1909, would you like to renew it? Also, what are your thoughts on the current power dynamics?
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, it seems that Turkey is now in a very weak position with only two units and two supply centers. I propose a joint action where I aim for Smyrna while Russia aims for Constantinople. You could hold your current positions or make a move on Serbia if necessary. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911 and work together to eliminate Turkey completely.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our joint action against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out of the picture, we should make a joint action against Italy. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From TURKEY: We have had a truce previously. Given our current vulnerable state, I propose a new truce or a potential joint plan against Italy or Russia. Could we work together to make sure we both survive and possibly grow stronger?

  From GERMANY: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. Given Italy's growing power with 7 supply centers, it makes sense for us to make a joint action plan against Italy. Let us coordinate on a strategy to weaken their position.
  From ITALY: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. Once Turkey is out of the picture, making a plan to deal with the growing power of France or Germany makes sense. For now, let us focus on eliminating Turkey. I suggest that you make a move on Serbia while I support you if necessary.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that Turkey seems nearly neutralized and that Italy is a significant threat with 7 supply centers. Let us make a final push to completely neutralize Turkey this round. Once that is done, a joint action against Italy makes sense. For now, let's plan a coordinated attack where I could support your moves into Vienna or Budapest if necessary. However, our immediate priority should be to make a final push against Turkey.
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, I agree that a joint effort against Italy makes sense given Italy's 7 supply centers. I could make a last stand against Italy if you provide support from Bulgaria. However, it is crucial that we make a coordinated plan to make sure that my units are not left vulnerable to Russia. I suggest that A BUL supports A CON to hold or move against Italian forces if necessary. Let us make a joint effort to weaken Italy's power in the region.

  From ENGLAND: Austria, it seems that Italy has become a significant threat with 7 supply centers. Given that you have 3 supply centers, it might be in our mutual interest to form an alliance against Italy. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb Italy's expansion?
  From GERMANY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. Do you need any support against Italy?
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. You should hold BUL and make a move on SER if necessary while I aim for Smyrna. Once Turkey is dealt with, we need to make a plan against another major power.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm the joint action against Turkey until it is neutralized and make a plan for a joint action against Italy once Turkey is out of the picture. However, we need to make sure that Italy does not become too powerful.
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, our joint effort against Italy seems to be a good plan.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From GERMANY: I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy makes sense. A TYR could be used to support any moves you make against Italy such as supporting an attack on VEN or TRI. A BUR is primarily for defensive purposes against France, but once Turkey is neutralized, it could be used to support any moves against Italy if necessary. Let us keep our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911.
  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact is still in place until the end of 1911. A VIE is primarily for defensive purposes and to make sure that no other power makes aggressive moves against us. I have no plans to make any aggressive moves against your units in SER or BUL. However, once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a plan for the Balkans and the Mediterranean.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that a final push against Turkey this fall is necessary. A CON can support A BUL to attack A SMY if necessary. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy makes sense. Let us make sure that Turkey is completely out of the game first.
  From TURKEY: Our temporary truce until the end of 1911 is still in place. I assure you that A SMY will not make any aggressive moves against your unit in BUL. However, I need to make a strategic move to ensure my survival. Any move I make should be seen as defensive rather than aggressive. Let us continue our joint plan against Italy.

  From GERMANY: Greetings. Given that Turkey is now nearly neutralized, should we continue our non-aggression pact and possibly plan a joint action against Italy? Italy currently holds the most supply centers and could be a significant threat. Your thoughts?
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. I propose a joint action against Turkey where I aim for Smyrna (F AEG - SMY) while you could make a move on Constantinople if Russia does not make a move there. Another option for you could be to make a move on Serbia if necessary. Once Turkey is dealt with, we should discuss our next steps.
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Turkey. I plan to move A CON to SMY supported by F BLA if necessary. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss a potential action against Italy, which has grown significantly.
  From TURKEY: Austria, our truce has been helpful until the end of 1911. Given the current situation, I propose that we extend our truce until the end of 1912 and possibly work together against Italy or Russia. What are your thoughts on this?

  From ENGLAND: Dear Austria, I agree that Italy is a significant threat with their 7 supply centers. Once Turkey is dealt with, I am interested in forming an alliance against Italy. Let us keep in touch and plan a coordinated action.
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, I agree that Italy has become a significant threat with 7 supply centers and a unit in PIE close to my unit in TUS. I am open to a coalition against Italy. Let us discuss a plan to counter Italy's growing power.
  From GERMANY: I agree that Italy is a growing threat with 7 supply centers now. Let's renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 and make a joint plan against Italy. Your A BUD could support my A TYR to move into VIE if the opportunity arises.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, our next target should be Italy. Italy now holds 7 supply centers and poses a significant threat. Let us make a plan to jointly act against Italy once Turkey is completely out of the game. For now, I plan to make a move on Ankara (A CON - ANK) to make a final push against Turkey. What are your plans for this round?

  From GERMANY: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. With Italy currently having 7 supply centers and units in former Austrian territories like Vienna, what are your thoughts on potential joint actions against Italy?
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. I propose a joint action against Turkey where I aim for Smyrna while you make a move on Bulgaria or possibly make a move on Constantinople if Russia does not make a move there. Once Turkey is dealt with, we should discuss our next steps together.
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out of the game, our next target should be Italy. We need to make a joint action against Italy where you make a move from the west while I make a move from the east.
  From TURKEY: I would like to reaffirm our truce until the end of 1912. Can we discuss any potential joint action against Italy or Russia?

            "thought": "Based on the current game state and the messages received, it seems that all major powers are interested in a non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. However, the main focus seems to be on neutralizing Turkey first and then making a joint action against Italy. 

France suggests a push against TRI and VIE. Germany wants to reaffirm a non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 and discuss potential joint actions against Italy. Italy wants to reaffirm a non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 and make a joint action against Turkey where Italy aims for Smyrna while Austria makes a move on Bulgaria or possibly Constantinople. Russia wants to make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized and then make a joint action against Italy. Turkey wants to reaffirm a truce until the end of 1912 and discuss potential joint action against Italy or Russia.

Based on the current supply center distribution, Italy has the most supply centers (7), followed by England and Russia (6 each), Germany (6), France (5), Austria (3), and Turkey (1). 

Given that Italy is the most powerful player currently, it makes sense for Austria to join a coalition against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. However, it is important to make sure that any actions against Italy are well-coordinated and that Austria does not make any aggressive moves until Turkey is completely out of the game. 

Based on this reasoning, the plan for this round should be:
1. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Germany until the end of 1912 and express willingness to discuss joint actions against Italy once Turkey is neutralized.
2. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Italy until the end of 1912 and agree to make a joint action against Turkey where Italy aims for Smyrna while Austria makes a move on Bulgaria or possibly supports a move on Constantinople if Russia does not make a move there.
3. Reaffirm the joint action plan with Russia against Turkey until it is neutralized and make a plan for a joint action against Italy once Turkey is out of the picture.
4. Reaffirm the truce with Turkey until the end of 1912 and express a willingness to discuss a potential joint action against Italy once Turkey stabilizes.
5. Respond to France's suggestion of a push against TRI and VIE by expressing a need to first make sure that Turkey is neutralized and then make a well-coordinated action against Italy.

The main goal should be to make sure that all major powers are on the same page regarding the plan to first neutralize Turkey and then make a joint action against Italy. This makes sense because Italy is currently the most powerful player and poses a significant threat to Austria's interests."

  From ENGLAND: Dear Austria, I agree that Italy is currently the strongest power and poses a significant threat. I am open to forming a broader alliance against Italy. Given your position, what specific actions do you propose for us to take against Italy? My naval presence could indeed help in the Mediterranean.
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, I acknowledge your proposal for an alliance against Italy. Italy is indeed a significant threat with 7 supply centers. However, any plan should be well-coordinated. I need to make sure that any actions against Italy are well-timed and well-coordinated with other powers such as Russia. Let us keep in touch and plan a joint action once the situation with Turkey is resolved.
  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Once the pact expires, I am open to discussing a joint action against Italy. My unit in Tyrolia could indeed play a key role in such a plan. Let us keep in touch for further coordination.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. My plan for the next year is to continue our joint action against Turkey where I aim for Smyrna while supporting you in retaking Bulgaria or making a move on Constantinople if Russia does not make a move there. Let us make sure that Turkey is completely eliminated from the game.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy should be our next step. I can support your move into Vienna (A BUD -> VIE) once Turkey is out of the game. Let us make a plan for the next year.
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, I appreciate your reaffirmation of our temporary truce until the end of 1912. Given our current situation, I am open to discussing a plan where I support you against Italy in exchange for a safe haven or a future role in the game. However, a full surrender is not an option yet. I propose that we make a joint action against Italy where I support your moves against Italy in exchange for a guarantee that you will not make any aggressive moves against me until the end of 1912. What specific actions do you have in mind?

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Fall of 1912, no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it had been since the end of Fall 1911, when Germany captured Belgium from England and Russia took Constantinople from Turkey."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1912R
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A BUL, A SER, A BUD
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "BUL"], ["A", "SER"], ["A", "BUD"]], "ENGLAND": [["A", "LON"], ["F", "NTH"], ["F", "EDI"], ["F", "SKA"], ["F", "BEL"], ["F", "BAL"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["F", "ENG"], ["A", "PIE"], ["F", "ROM"], ["F", "WES"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "BUR"], ["F", "SWE"], ["A", "TYR"], ["A", "RUH"], ["A", "SIL"], ["*A", "BEL"]], "ITALY": [["F", "GRE"], ["A", "VEN"], ["A", "VIE"], ["F", "AEG"], ["F", "ION"], ["F", "NAP"], ["F", "TYS"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "GAL"], ["A", "SEV"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "BLA"]], "TURKEY": [["A", "SMY"]]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Austria, Italy is the leading power with 7 centers. Given that you only have 3 centers, it might be in our mutual interest to form an alliance against Italy. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb Italy's expansion?
  From GERMANY: Hello Austria, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Given Italy's strong position with 7 supply centers, do you think it makes sense for us to discuss any potential joint actions against Italy?
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Given that Turkey only has one unit in Smyrna, let us make a coordinated attack where I aim for Smyrna while supporting you in retaking Bulgaria or making a move on Constantinople if Russia does not make a move there. What are your thoughts?
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once that is done, a joint action against Italy should be our next step. A GAL can support moves into BOH or VIE. Please confirm your agreement.
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, given our past truces and joint actions against Italy, I propose that we make a new truce until the end of 1912. Additionally, if you feel threatened by Russia's strong presence in the region, a joint action against them might be beneficial for us both.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Austria, Italy still has 6 centers and poses a significant threat. Given that you only have 3 centers, it might be in our mutual interest to form an alliance against Italy. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb Italy's expansion?
  From GERMANY: Hello, Austria. I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Given that you have 3 units and 3 supply centers, it might be beneficial for us to make a plan against a common threat such as Italy or Russia. What are your thoughts on a potential alliance against Italy?
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Let us continue our joint action against Turkey where I aim for Smyrna while supporting you in retaking Bulgaria if necessary. We need to make sure that Turkey is completely eliminated so that we can focus on other threats such as France.
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Turkey this round. Once Turkey is out, we should make a coordinated action against Italy. A GAL can support any strategic moves you make against Italy.
  From TURKEY: Given our previous truces and joint actions against Italy, I would like to reaffirm any previous agreements and propose a new joint action against Russia or Italy. Your unit in Bulgaria could be crucial in our coordinated efforts. What are your thoughts?

  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, our next target should be Italy. I am open to a joint action where my unit in Galicia could support an attack on Vienna or Bohemia if needed. Let us make a specific plan once Turkey is out.
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, I accept your final peace offer. Given Russia's clear intent to push until I am out of the game, a joint action against Russia seems most prudent. How can we work together to counter Russia's aggression?

  From GERMANY: Hello, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Given that Turkey is nearly neutralized, do you think a joint action against Italy could be a strategic move for us?
  From ITALY: Let us make a final push against Turkey's remaining unit in Smyrna. A coordinated attack should ensure that Turkey is eliminated from the game. Once Turkey is dealt with, we can focus on other strategic goals. Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913 still stands.
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push to eliminate Turkey this round. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a joint action against Italy where A GAL could support an attack on VIE or BOH. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From TURKEY: I propose a joint action plan where we support each other against Italy or Russia. Given that you have a unit in BUL, it makes sense for us to work together to defend against any potential attacks from Italy or Russia. What do you think?

  From ENGLAND: Dear Austria, I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy makes sense. Let us make a plan for a coordinated attack on Italy. What specific moves do you propose for this round?
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, I agree that Italy poses a significant threat. I am open to a joint action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. It makes sense for us to coordinate such actions with England and Russia as well. Let us keep in touch and plan a well-coordinated attack once Turkey is out of the picture.
  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I agree that our non-aggression pact should remain valid until the end of 1913. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy seems like a sound strategy. Italy has grown significantly and poses a threat to us both. Let us make a coordinated plan once the non-aggression pact ends.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I agree that our non-aggression pact should be valid until the end of 1913. Once Turkey is completely neutralized, I am open to continuing our cooperation if it makes strategic sense for both of us. Let us make a final push against Turkey this round.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, our joint action should focus on Italy. I suggest that A GAL could support any strategic moves you make against Italy such as retaking VIE or TRI. Let us make a plan to attack Italy from both the north and the east once Turkey is out of the picture.
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, thank you for your offer. Given my dire situation, a joint action against Italy or Russia sounds like a viable plan. Could you please provide a more specific plan for such a joint action? For example, how could our units work together to make a meaningful impact against Italy or Russia? I am open to a coordinated attack where I make a last defensive stand in Smyrna while you might use your units in Bulgaria and Serbia to make a coordinated attack on Italy's units in Greece and Venice.

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Fall 1913 Movement phase, once again, no centers changed ownership. The territorial control remained stable compared to the previous Spring 1913 Movement phase, with England still holding Belgium and France still holding Rome. The overall power distribution among the major powers remained the same as it was previously."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Austria, you might need allies given your current 3 centers. How about a joint plan against France or Italy to help balance power and strengthen both of our positions?
  From GERMANY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Once Turkey is neutralized, what are your thoughts on a joint action against Italy or Russia?
  From ITALY: Let's make a final push against Turkey this round. I suggest that you focus on retaking Bulgaria and Greece if necessary. My fleet in AEG can support your move to BUL or provide cover for any other actions you need. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a plan for other strategic moves.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, let's make a final joint action against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out of the game, a coordinated action against Italy should be our next goal. A GAL could support any strategic moves against Italy once Turkey is further weakened.
  From TURKEY: I reaffirm any truce we have until the end of 1913. Given that RUSSIA is a common threat to us, I propose a joint action plan where you support TURKEY in defending Smyrna against a potential RUSSIA attack. Any support you can provide will be crucial for my survival and could strengthen our alliance.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

  From ENGLAND: Austria, France has now reached 7 supply centers and poses a significant threat. Given that you have 5 supply centers and a strong position in the Balkans, it makes sense for us to make a plan against France. What specific moves do you propose for a coordinated attack on France this round?
  From GERMANY: Austria, it seems that our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913 worked well for us. I propose that we extend this pact until the end of 1914. Additionally, let us make sure that our units do not make any aggressive moves against each other. Do you agree?
  From ITALY: Let us make a final push against Turkey this round. Once Turkey is neutralized, we need to address the threat from France. I propose that we continue our joint action until Turkey is completely eliminated.
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Turkey this round. Once Turkey is neutralized, A GAL can support your move into BOH or VIE if necessary. We need to make sure that Turkey is completely out of the game so that we can focus on Italy.
  From TURKEY: Let us reaffirm any previous truce until the end of 1914. I propose that we make a new one where Turkey makes no aggressive moves and Austria agrees not to attack SMY. This would allow us both to focus on other threats such as Russia or Italy. What do you think?

  From ENGLAND: I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy makes sense. However, once Italy is out, we need to make a plan against France, who has 7 centers and is a significant power. What specific moves do you propose for a coordinated attack on Italy this round?
  From FRANCE: I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, Italy should be our next mutual target. I plan to make a move on VEN from PIE and make a naval attack on TUN. Let us coordinate our actions against Italy once Turkey is out of the game. However, I need to make sure that any actions you take do not threaten my interests in Italy such as Rome or Naples.
  From GERMANY: I agree to renew the non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy sounds beneficial. I plan to make a move on VEN from TYR and support any of your moves on TRI. Let's make a more detailed plan once Turkey is out of the picture.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that a final push against Turkey is necessary. I plan to move A CON to SMY supported by A ARM. Once Turkey is out of the game, I am ready to make a well-coordinated attack on Italy. I can support your move on TRI with A BUD supported by A VIE by using A GAL to support your A BUD to TRI.
  From TURKEY: I need to reaffirm our truce until the end of 1914. I make no aggressive moves against you if you make no aggressive moves against me. Can we agree on that?

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring 1914 Movement phase (S1914M), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it was after the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy. The status quo in terms of supply center distribution was maintained once again."}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring 1914 Movement phase (S1914M), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it was after the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy. The status quo in terms of supply center distribution was maintained once again."}

Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A GRE, A VIE, A SER, A TRI

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Austria, France has become the leading power with 7 supply centers. It might be in our mutual interest to make a plan against France. What specific moves do you propose for a joint action against France?
  From GERMANY: Hello, Austria. I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Additionally, given that Italy seems to be weakened, do you think it would be beneficial for us to make a joint action against Italy or perhaps against France? What are your thoughts?
  From ITALY: Austria, you have captured Vienna and Greece from us and hold a unit in Trieste which is one of our supply centers. Can we negotiate a peaceful resolution where we both focus on other threats such as France or Russia?
  From RUSSIA: We reaffirm our joint action against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out, we should plan a joint action against Italy. Let us know your thoughts.
  From TURKEY: I propose a joint action plan against Russia. Given that you have a unit in Greece (A GRE), any support against a potential Russian attack on Smyrna would be greatly appreciated. Let us work together to counter the Russian threat.

  From ENGLAND: Dear Austria, I agree that a well-coordinated action against Italy should be our next step once Turkey is neutralized. I can make a naval move on TUN to support our efforts. Let us make a plan for a coordinated attack on Italy once Turkey is neutralized. What specific moves do you propose for this round?
  From FRANCE: We agree that a well-coordinated action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized would be beneficial. Our units in NAP and PIE could indeed make a move on VEN or TUN. Let us keep the lines of communication open and plan a joint action once Turkey is out of the picture.
  From GERMANY: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Once Turkey is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Italy makes sense. My unit in TYR can support an attack on VEN or TRI. Let us keep in touch for a more detailed plan once Turkey is out of the picture.
  From ITALY: I agree that a final push against Turkey is necessary. Once Turkey is neutralized, instead of targeting Russia, I believe a well-coordinated action against France should be our next priority. France has captured Naples from us and has become a leading power with 7 supply centers. What do you think about this plan?
  From RUSSIA: I agree that a final push against Turkey is necessary. Once Turkey is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Italy makes sense. My unit in GAL can support an attack on VEN or TRI once Turkey is out of the picture.
  From TURKEY: Austria, what does a 'peaceful surrender' entail? Are there any conditions where you would support me in making a joint action against Russia while I still have a unit on the board? Once I am out of the game, I am open to making a plan for joint action against Russia or another power.

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring 1914 Movement phase (S1914M), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it was after the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy. The status quo in terms of supply center distribution was maintained once again."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Austria, France is currently the most powerful nation along with England, holding 7 supply centers. It might be in our mutual interest to make a plan against them. What are your thoughts on a coordinated action against France?
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, it seems that Italy is on the brink of collapse. Let us make sure that our actions are coordinated against Italy. Once Italy is neutralized, what are your plans for the future?
  From GERMANY: Hello, Austria. Our non-aggression pact is in place until the end of 1914. Do you have any plans for a joint action against another power such as Italy or France? It seems that Italy is quite weak now and might be a potential target.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, our joint action against Turkey has been successful. However, France still holds a significant threat to us both. Once Turkey is completely neutralized, I propose a joint action against France. Perhaps you could make a move towards MAR or PIE while I aim to retake Naples and make a push towards Rome. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914 and plan our next steps against France.
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Turkey this round so that we can neutralize them completely. Once Turkey is out of the picture, we should make a well-coordinated action against Italy where A GAL could support an attack on VEN or TRI.
  From TURKEY: I reaffirm our truce until the end of 1914. Given my current situation, I propose a joint action plan against Russia where I make no aggressive moves against you. If it ensures a 'peaceful surrender' where you take Smyrna, I am open to such a plan.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1914M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Italy makes sense. My naval presence can make a move on Italy's remaining supply centers such as TUN or VEN. What specific moves do you propose for a coordinated attack on Italy this round?
  From FRANCE: I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Italy makes sense. My units in Naples (F NAP) and the Ionian Sea (F ION) could make a move on Italy's remaining units and supply centers such as TUN or VEN. However, any action should be well-coordinated to ensure that we both benefit from the operation. I aim to secure Rome and possibly TUN.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Once Turkey is neutralized, let's make a well-coordinated action against Italy. A TYR can support an attack on either VEN or TRI once Turkey's unit in SMY is dealt with. Let us plan the specifics once Turkey has been neutralized.
  From ITALY: I agree with making a temporary truce until Turkey is neutralized. Once that is done, I believe that France should be our next priority given their current strength and the fact that they hold Naples. Let us make a final push against Turkey and then plan a joint action against France.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that making a final push against Turkey's remaining unit in Smyrna (A SMY) is a priority. Once Turkey is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Italy makes sense. I suggest that A CON and A ANK move on A SMY while your units make a move on Italy's remaining units and supply centers.
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, my situation is extremely precarious. I am open to making no aggressive moves if it means a peaceful surrender where I can make a graceful exit. Could you provide any diplomatic gesture such as a 'peaceful transition'? Any support against Russia would also be appreciated.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Winter 1914 Adjustment phase (W1914A), no supply centers changed hands. Consequently, any unit adjustments made by the powers would be based on the supply center distribution from the end of the Fall 1914 Movement phase where Austria successfully captured Trieste from Italy, thus increasing Austria's supply center count while decreasing Italy's. The specific unit builds or disbands for this phase are not specified here, but the ownership of supply centers remains unchanged."}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Winter 1914 Adjustment phase (W1914A), no supply centers changed hands. Consequently, any unit adjustments made by the powers would be based on the supply center distribution from the end of the Fall 1914 Movement phase where Austria successfully captured Trieste from Italy, thus increasing Austria's supply center count while decreasing Italy's. The specific unit builds or disbands for this phase are not specified here, but the ownership of supply centers remains unchanged."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Dear Austria, Italy now only has 2 supply centers and seems to be a less significant threat. France has 7 supply centers and is a major power in the game. Would you be open to a joint plan against France to prevent them from becoming too dominant? What specific moves do you propose for a coordinated action against France?
  From FRANCE: Hello, Austria. I recall that you suggested a coordinated action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. It seems that Turkey is close to being neutralized. Would you be interested in a joint plan against Italy? What are your thoughts?
  From GERMANY: Hello Austria, I propose that we extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Additionally, once Turkey is neutralized, I suggest that we consider a joint action against Italy. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Given that France has a significant presence in Italy, I seek your support in retaking Rome from France. If you agree to help me retake Rome, I am willing to make a joint effort against France and would appreciate if you could return Trieste to Italy once Rome is retaken. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: Once Turkey is neutralized, our next target should be Italy. However, we need to keep an eye on France and England, who each have 7 supply centers. What do you suggest?
  From TURKEY: I propose a 'peaceful surrender' where I make no aggressive moves if you allow me to keep Smyrna until the end of the game phase. Given that you already hold a strong position in the region, I hope you might find this arrangement acceptable.

  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, I agree to a joint action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. However, Naples is already under French control (F NAP), so our main target should be Venice and possibly Tunis. Let us make a plan once Turkey is out of the picture.
  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I agree to a new non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy makes sense. However, we should also consider a joint action against France once Turkey is no longer a threat. Let us keep in close communication.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against France seems like a viable plan. However, until then, we should continue focusing on neutralizing Turkey. Once that is done, I am open to a joint action against France where we aim to regain my lost territories such as Rome and Naples.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that a final push against Turkey until it is completely neutralized is a priority. Once that is done, a well-coordinated action against Italy makes sense given that Italy is already weakened. Let us make a plan to make a joint action against Italy once Turkey is out of the game.
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, thank you for your message. Could you please specify what terms a 'peaceful surrender' would entail? Is there a way for me to keep my unit in Smyrna until a certain point if I make no aggressive moves? Additionally, if there is a joint action plan against Russia or Italy where my unit could make a meaningful impact, I would be interested in hearing it.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

Phase: S1915R, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Spring 1915 Movement phase (S1915M), no supply centers changed hands. The territorial control thus remained the same as it was after the Fall 1914 Movement phase, where Austria had captured Trieste from Italy. The phase passed without any significant changes in the ownership of supply centers."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1915R
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A GRE, A VIE, A TRI, A ALB, A BUD
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "GRE"], ["A", "VIE"], ["A", "TRI"], ["A", "ALB"], ["A", "BUD"]], "ENGLAND": [["A", "LON"], ["F", "BAL"], ["F", "DEN"], ["F", "PIC"], ["F", "IRI"], ["F", "BRE"], ["F", "BEL"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["A", "PIE"], ["F", "NAP"], ["A", "MAR"], ["F", "SPA/NC"], ["F", "TUN"], ["*F", "BRE"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "BUR"], ["F", "SWE"], ["A", "TYR"], ["A", "RUH"], ["A", "BOH"]], "ITALY": [["A", "VEN"], ["F", "EAS"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "GAL"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "BLA"], ["F", "STP/NC"], ["A", "ANK"]], "TURKEY": [["A", "SMY"]]}
  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "BUL", "GRE", "SER", "TRI", "VIE"], "ENGLAND": ["BEL", "DEN", "EDI", "HOL", "LON", "LVP", "NWY"], "FRANCE": ["BRE", "MAR", "NAP", "PAR", "POR", "ROM", "SPA"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "KIE", "MUN", "SWE", "WAR"], "ITALY": ["TUN", "VEN"], "RUSSIA": ["ANK", "CON", "MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "STP"], "TURKEY": ["SMY"]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Austria, France has 7 supply centers and is a significant threat. A joint plan against France could be beneficial. Your units such as A ALB and A TRI could put pressure on France's Italian holdings such as NAP and ROM. What are your thoughts on a coordinated action against France?
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, I want to reaffirm our joint plan against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. Let us make sure that we are ready to act together once the time comes.
  From GERMANY: Hello, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Given that Russia seems to be making progress against Turkey, what is the plan for once Turkey is neutralized? Should we consider a joint action against Italy or another power?
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I hope our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915 still stands. Given our current joint action against Turkey is progressing well, I need your support in retaking Rome from France once Turkey is neutralized. What is your stance on this? Additionally, any support in defending VEN would be greatly appreciated.
  From RUSSIA: We need to make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once that is done, we should make a well-coordinated action against Italy. How do you plan to make moves against Italy once Turkey is out of the game?
  From TURKEY: I propose a 'peaceful surrender' where Turkey makes no aggressive moves if you allow us to keep Smyrna until the end of the game phase. This would allow us to exit the game gracefully without further conflict.

Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Dear Austria, I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a well-coordinated action should be our next step. However, given that France has made significant advances and now has 7 supply centers, equal to mine, I believe that France might be a more significant threat. I propose that once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a plan to act against France. What are your thoughts on this?
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Italy should be our next step. A naval attack on VEN could be part of the plan where I could support your move into VEN while I make a land attack on PIE if necessary. However, such a plan should be executed once Turkey is completely out of the game. Let us keep in touch for a more detailed plan once that happens.
  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Italy should be our next step. A move from BOH to support an attack on VEN from TYR could indeed be part of the plan. However, we need to make sure that any action against Italy should be well-coordinated and should not leave us vulnerable to other powers such as France or England. Let us keep in close communication as the situation develops.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I acknowledge our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against another power makes sense. Given that France seems to be a more immediate threat to my remaining centers such as VEN and TUN, a joint action against France might be a priority. However, I am open to discussing any other plans you might have, such as against Russia.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that a final push against Turkey is necessary. Once Turkey is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Italy makes sense. A CON could support A ANK to attack Smyrna (A ANK -> SMY supported by A CON). Once Turkey is out, we should make a plan to make a joint action against Italy where A GAL could support any strategic moves against Italy.
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, I am open to a peaceful surrender where I make no aggressive moves, but I need to understand what a 'joint action' against another power such as Russia or Italy would entail once I am 'neutralized.' Can you elaborate on what that would mean for my unit in Smyrna?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Austria, France now has 7 centers and might be a threat to us both. What are your plans for this round? Can we make a joint plan against France?
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, it seems that Turkey is close to being neutralized. Once that is done, I propose a joint plan against Italy. Your unit in Albania could be used to put pressure on Italy. Let us make a coordinated effort to make sure that Italy is neutralized as well.
  From GERMANY: Hello Austria, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. How do you see the current situation and any potential joint actions against other powers?
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against France makes sense. I need your support to retake Rome from France. Can we make a coordinated move against France once Turkey is dealt with?
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Turkey. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a well-coordinated action against Italy. How do you plan to make a move against Italy once Turkey is completely out of the game?
  From TURKEY: Dear Austria, once again, I propose a peaceful surrender where I make no aggressive moves if you allow me to keep Smyrna until the end of the game phase. I am willing to make any concessions necessary for a peaceful conclusion. Please consider a truce where I make no moves against you.

  From ENGLAND: Dear Austria, I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy makes sense. After Italy is neutralized, a well-coordinated plan against France could be a good next step. I am open to making a naval move on NAP or TUN once Turkey is out of the game. Let us make a plan for a coordinated attack on Italy once Turkey is neutralized.
  From FRANCE: I agree with your plan for a joint action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. Making a move on Venice from Piedmont once Turkey is out of the game seems like a valid strategy. Let us keep in close communication as the situation develops.
  From GERMANY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy could be a strategic move. However, we should also consider a joint action against France once Turkey is out of the game. Let us keep our options open and make a plan once Turkey is neutralized.
  From ITALY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against France makes sense. France has been a significant threat to us both. Let us make a plan for a coordinated attack on France once Turkey is out of the game.
  From RUSSIA: Agreed on making a final push against Turkey's last unit in Smyrna. Once Turkey is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Italy makes sense. I believe A GAL can support an attack on VEN from TRI once Turkey is out of the game. Let's make a plan once Turkey is neutralized.
  From TURKEY: Thank you for your message. Can you please elaborate on what a 'peaceful surrender' would entail? If Turkey makes no aggressive moves and allows you to take Smyrna, what would be the terms of such a surrender?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Austria, France is a growing power with seven supply centers. It might be in our mutual interest to make a plan against France. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb France's expansion?
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, once Turkey is neutralized, it makes sense for us to continue our joint plan against Italy. Let's make sure that we are coordinated in our next moves and that our efforts are aligned.
  From GERMANY: Hello, Austria. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. However, I noticed that you have a unit in TYR which is close to MUN. Can you confirm that your intentions are peaceful in that region?
  From ITALY: I hope all is well. Given our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915, I need assurance that you will not make any aggressive moves against Venice. I am planning to make a move against France to retake Rome and Naples. Could we coordinate our efforts against France?
  From RUSSIA: It seems that Turkey is on the brink of being eliminated. Once Turkey is neutralized, let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy as previously agreed. What are your thoughts on the next steps?
  From TURKEY: My only unit (A SMY) has been dislodged by Russia. I need any last-ditch diplomatic support you can provide. If you can help me keep Smyrna until the end of the game phase, I will make no aggressive moves.

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1915R
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Dear Austria, I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a well-coordinated plan against Italy makes sense. Your units could make a move on VEN while I make a naval move against NAP. Let us plan our next moves carefully.
  From FRANCE: I agree that a well-coordinated action against Italy once the non-aggression pact expires at the end of 1915 makes sense. However, any such action should be planned such that France keeps control of Rome and Naples while Austria can aim for Venice and possibly Tunis if feasible. Let us make a plan that ensures a balanced distribution of Italian territories.
  From GERMANY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Once Turkey is out of the game, a joint action against Italy makes sense. Let us make a plan for a coordinated attack once the non-aggression pact expires.
  From ITALY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. However, once that ends, it seems that France poses a significant threat to both of us. Perhaps we should make a plan against France once our pact ends. What are your thoughts?
  From RUSSIA: I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Italy makes sense. Let us make a plan where you make a move on VEN and I could support you or make a joint attack on another Italian territory like TUN if necessary.
  From TURKEY: Given that Russia has taken Smyrna and seems to be a significant threat, I am open to an alliance against Russia. Any support from you could be helpful. What specific actions can you take to help us against Russia?

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: RETREAT / OTHER
CRITICAL: Submit orders appropriate for this phase type (e.g., Retreat or Disband for units needing retreats). Consult rules.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Winter 1915 Adjustment phase (W1915A), there were no changes in the ownership of supply centers. England retained control of Brest (BRE) which it had captured from France in the previous phase, while Russia continued to hold Smyrna (SMY) which it had taken from Turkey. The lack of new center captures indicates a period of consolidation where the powers focused on reinforcing their current positions rather than expanding their territories."}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Winter 1915 Adjustment phase (W1915A), there were no changes in the ownership of supply centers. England retained control of Brest (BRE) which it had captured from France in the previous phase, while Russia continued to hold Smyrna (SMY) which it had taken from Turkey. The lack of new center captures indicates a period of consolidation where the powers focused on reinforcing their current positions rather than expanding their territories."}

Phase: S1916M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

  Your Units: A GRE, A VIE, A TRI, A ALB, A BUD

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Dear Austria, France has 6 supply centers and poses a threat on the Western front. Given that Russia has 7 supply centers and might be a threat in the long term, what are your thoughts on a joint plan against France or Russia? Any coordinated action could help us both to secure our positions.
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, with Turkey now neutralized, I was wondering if there are any plans you would like to make concerning Italy or any other power. Previously, we had discussed a joint plan against Italy once Turkey was out of the game. What are your current intentions and any potential plans for us to work together?
  From GERMANY: Hello Austria, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. Additionally, given that Italy only has two supply centers and two units, it might be a good opportunity for us to make a joint action against Italy. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, now that Turkey has been eliminated, our main threat seems to be France which holds Rome and Naples. I propose that we reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916 and make a joint action against France. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, now that Turkey is neutralized, it's time to make a well-coordinated action against Italy. I suggest that Russia makes a move on VEN while Austria makes a move on TUN. Once Italy is out of the game, we should make a plan against the next major power.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Dear Austria, I agree that a joint action against Italy makes sense given that Turkey is out of the game. However, Italy is now weaker with only two centers. I propose that we make a plan to divide Italy's remaining centers. You should focus on Venice while I can support naval actions against Tunis if necessary. What are your specific plans for attacking Venice?
  From FRANCE: Austria, I agree that now that Turkey is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Italy makes sense. My units in A PIE and A MAR could indeed be useful here. Let us make a plan to ensure that Italy is neutralized. However, we need to make sure that any action against Italy does not leave us vulnerable to England or Germany.
  From GERMANY: I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. A well-coordinated action against Italy makes sense now that Turkey is neutralized. Let us make a plan where both our forces make a joint action against Italy. It would be beneficial to make sure that Russia is also on board for this plan.
  From ITALY: Austria, I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. Since Turkey seems to be neutralized already, a joint action against France makes sense. France currently holds Rome and Naples which were originally mine. Reclaiming these could help us both. What do you think about making a coordinated attack on France?
  From RUSSIA: I agree that our next target should be Italy. A GAL can support any strategic moves you make against Italy. Let us make a well-coordinated action where A GAL supports your moves into VEN or TUN.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring 1916 Movement phase (S1916M), there were no changes in the ownership of supply centers. This phase continues the trend of consolidation observed in the previous Winter 1915 Adjustment phase, where the major powers appear to be focusing on strategic positioning and defense rather than making new territorial gains. The lack of new center captures suggests that the powers may be maneuvering their units in preparation for future engagements or are in a stalemate where no significant advances were made."}

Phase: F1916M, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring 1916 Movement phase (S1916M), there were no changes in the ownership of supply centers. This phase continues the trend of consolidation observed in the previous Winter 1915 Adjustment phase, where the major powers appear to be focusing on strategic positioning and defense rather than making new territorial gains. The lack of new center captures suggests that the powers may be maneuvering their units in preparation for future engagements or are in a stalemate where no significant advances were made."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1916M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A GRE, A VIE, A TRI, A ALB, A BUD
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "GRE"], ["A", "VIE"], ["A", "TRI"], ["A", "ALB"], ["A", "BUD"]], "ENGLAND": [["A", "LON"], ["F", "BAL"], ["F", "DEN"], ["F", "PIC"], ["F", "IRI"], ["F", "BRE"], ["F", "BEL"], ["F", "EDI"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["A", "PIE"], ["A", "MAR"], ["F", "SPA/NC"], ["F", "MAO"], ["F", "TYS"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "BUR"], ["F", "SWE"], ["A", "TYR"], ["A", "KIE"], ["A", "MUN"]], "ITALY": [["A", "VEN"], ["F", "ION"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "GAL"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "BLA"], ["F", "STP/NC"], ["A", "ANK"], ["A", "SMY"], ["F", "SEV"]], "TURKEY": []}
  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "BUL", "GRE", "SER", "TRI", "VIE"], "ENGLAND": ["BEL", "BRE", "DEN", "EDI", "HOL", "LON", "LVP", "NWY"], "FRANCE": ["MAR", "NAP", "PAR", "POR", "ROM", "SPA"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "KIE", "MUN", "SWE", "WAR"], "ITALY": ["TUN", "VEN"], "RUSSIA": ["ANK", "CON", "MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "SMY", "STP"], "TURKEY": []}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Dear Austria, it seems that Russia has 7 centers and could become a significant threat. Would you be interested in making a joint plan against Russia if you see them as a threat? It is important to maintain a balance of power where no single power becomes too strong.
  From FRANCE: Hello, Turkey is now out of the game. I believe it is now time for us to act on our previous agreement to coordinate against Italy if you are still interested. What is your current plan regarding Italy?
  From GERMANY: Hello, Austria. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. What are your strategic plans for this round?
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. Given that France holds Rome and Naples, which are rightfully Italian territories, I propose a joint action against France. Your support in retaking Rome and Naples would be greatly appreciated. Once we have retaken these territories, we can discuss further cooperation. What are your thoughts on a coordinated attack on France's units in PIE and MAR?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, it seems that Turkey has been completely eliminated. Our next target should be Italy. I propose a well-coordinated action where A GAL could support any strategic moves you make against Italy, such as a move into VEN or TUN. Once Italy is neutralized, we should plan our next steps together.

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.

== CURRENT GAME STATE (Focus!) ==
  Your Units: A GRE, A VIE, A TRI, A ALB, A BUD
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "GRE"], ["A", "VIE"], ["A", "TRI"], ["A", "ALB"], ["A", "BUD"]], "ENGLAND": [["A", "LON"], ["F", "BAL"], ["F", "DEN"], ["F", "PIC"], ["F", "IRI"], ["F", "BRE"], ["F", "BEL"], ["F", "EDI"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["A", "PIE"], ["A", "MAR"], ["F", "SPA/NC"], ["F", "MAO"], ["F", "TYS"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "BUR"], ["F", "SWE"], ["A", "TYR"], ["A", "KIE"], ["A", "MUN"]], "ITALY": [["A", "VEN"], ["F", "ION"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "GAL"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "BLA"], ["F", "STP/NC"], ["A", "ANK"], ["A", "SMY"], ["F", "SEV"]], "TURKEY": []}

Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Dear Austria, I agree that a well-coordinated action against Italy could make us all stronger. However, it is important that any action against Italy does not make another power such as Russia or Germany too strong. What specific moves do you propose against Italy?
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, I agree that a well-coordinated action against Italy makes sense now that Turkey is neutralized. I plan to make a move on Naples or Tunis from the sea. Could you make a move on Venice to put pressure on Italy from the north? Let us make a plan to ensure that Italy is neutralized effectively.
  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. I agree that Italy should be our next target. Your suggestion for a well-coordinated action against Italy makes sense. Let us plan an attack on Venice from Munich. How should we make the most effective move? Perhaps A MUN can support an attack on Venice if you make a move from Trieste. Let us make a well-coordinated action.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. Given that our borders are secure, a joint action against France makes sense. France currently holds Rome and Naples, which rightfully belong to Italy. I am open to making a coordinated plan to retake these territories together. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that a well-coordinated action against Italy makes sense. I propose that you make a move on Venice from Trieste while I make a move on Venice from Galicia. Additionally, if you make a move on Tunis, I can support any strategic moves you make against Italy. Let us make a plan to make sure Italy is neutralized as well.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "F MAO - SPA" } },

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Austria, Russia has now become the leading power with 8 supply centers and has units such as A GAL and F RUM close to your borders. It might make sense for us to make a joint plan against Russia. What are your thoughts on a coordinated action?
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, it seems that Italy is on the verge of being eliminated. Would you be interested in a coordinated action to make a final push against Italy?
  From GERMANY: Hello, Austria. I propose we extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. How does that sound? Also, what are your plans for A TYR?
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I propose that we continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Given that France holds Rome and Naples, which should be part of Italy, I would appreciate your support in retaking these territories. A joint action against France could be beneficial for both of us. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Italy. I suggest that you make a move on Venice while I make a move on Tuscany. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a plan against France.

  From ENGLAND: Austria, your plan makes sense. Neutralizing Italy should be a priority. I can make a move on TUN from the sea. However, once Italy is neutralized, we should indeed make a plan against Russia, who has become the most powerful player. Let us make a coordinated plan for S1917M. What specific moves do you suggest for attacking VEN and how should I make a move on TUN? Perhaps F BRE could move to GAS, then MAO, and eventually TUN.
  From FRANCE: I agree to a joint action against Italy. I will make a move on Naples while you make a move on Venice. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a plan against Russia, who is now the most powerful player with 8 supply centers.
  From GERMANY: I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. A joint action against Italy makes sense where you make a move on VEN while I make a move with A TYR towards Italy. Once Italy is neutralized, we should indeed make a plan against Russia, who now holds 8 supply centers and is the most powerful player.
  From ITALY: Austria, I acknowledge that our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916 has expired. However, I reject the 'peaceful surrender' proposal where I give up VEN and another power takes TUN. Instead, I propose a new non-aggression pact until the end of 1917 where I keep my current centers (TUN and VEN) and units (A TUS and F TYS) intact. Given that Russia is the leading power with 8 centers, it might make sense for us to make a joint plan against a common threat such as Russia. What are your thoughts?
  From RUSSIA: I agree to make a well-coordinated action against Italy where you make a move on TUN while I make a move on VEN. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a plan to ensure that no single power becomes too dominant.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Spring 1917 Movement phase (S1917M) did not result in any changes in supply center ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was after the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase (W1916A), where Germany gained Holland from England while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw).}

Phase: S1917R, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Spring 1917 Movement phase (S1917M) did not result in any changes in supply center ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was after the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase (W1916A), where Germany gained Holland from England while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw).}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Austria, Russia now has 8 centers and is the leading power. Given our mutual interests in maintaining a balance of power, it might make sense for us to make a plan against Russia. What are your thoughts on a coordinated action?
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, let us coordinate a final push against Italy to make sure that they are completely neutralized. Once Italy is out of the game, what should be done with the remaining Italian territories?
  From GERMANY: Hello Austria, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Given that Turkey is now neutralized, what are your plans for the next round? Do you need any support from us?
  From ITALY: Austria, let us make sure that our units in VEN and ROM are not threatened. A joint plan against France once Russia is handled could make sense for us both.
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy this round where I make a move on Tuscany and you make a move on Venice. Once Italy is neutralized, we need to make a new plan against the next major power such as France or Germany.

  From ENGLAND: I agree that a well-coordinated action against Italy is crucial until it is completely neutralized. Once Italy is out, we should make a plan against the next major threat, which seems to be a power struggle between France and Germany. However, we need to make a plan that keeps a balance of power so that no single power becomes too dominant. What specific moves do you propose for this round?
  From FRANCE: I agree that a well-coordinated action against Italy is our priority. Once Italy is neutralized, we need to make a plan against the next major threat. Given that Russia currently has the most supply centers, it might be prudent to make a plan against them once Italy is out of the way. What are your thoughts on this?
  From GERMANY: We agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Once Italy is neutralized, making a plan against Russia makes sense given that they are the most powerful power currently. Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy first.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, we appreciate the non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. However, any move on Venice would be a significant breach of our pact and a major act of aggression. VEN is one of our only two supply centers and its loss would be a severe blow. We need to make sure that our borders are secure by maintaining our current holdings. Can we continue to keep our non-aggression pact intact until the end of 1917?
  From RUSSIA: I agree that a well-coordinated action against Italy should be our priority until it is neutralized. Once Italy is out of the game, we should make a plan against the next major threat. Let us make sure that our actions are well-coordinated.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: RETREAT / OTHER
CRITICAL: Submit orders appropriate for this phase type (e.g., Retreat or Disband for units needing retreats). Consult rules.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "F MAO - SPA" } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "A PIC S F MAO - SPA" } },

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1917 Retreat phase (S1917R), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was after the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase where Germany gained Holland from England while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw). The retreat phase did not result in any new unit movements or dislodgments, thus maintaining the status quo established in the previous movement phase.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1917 Retreat phase (S1917R), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was after the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase where Germany gained Holland from England while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw). The retreat phase did not result in any new unit movements or dislodgments, thus maintaining the status quo established in the previous movement phase.}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1917M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A VIE, A ALB, A BUD, A SER, A VEN

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Austria, Russia is now the leading power with 8 supply centers. It might be in our mutual interest to make a plan against Russia to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb Russia's expansion?
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, let us coordinate for a final push against Italy. They only have two supply centers (TUN and VEN) and two units (F TYS and A ROM). A joint action could be planned to eliminate Italy from the game. What are your thoughts on this?
  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I need to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Additionally, it appears that Italy still has some units. Should we continue our plan for a joint action against Italy until it is neutralized? Once Italy is out, what should be our next move?
  From ITALY: We propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Let us make sure that our units do not conflict, especially regarding VEN.
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is neutralized. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a plan to act against any remaining threats such as France or Germany.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Dear Austria, I agree with your plan to make a joint action against Italy where I make a move on Naples or Tunis from the sea once Italy is neutralized. However, given that Russia is currently the dominant power with 8 supply centers, a plan against Russia might indeed be necessary once Italy is neutralized. Let us make a well-coordinated plan for the next round.
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, I agree that a joint action against Italy should be our priority. Once Italy is neutralized, it makes sense to make a plan against another major power such as Russia if Russia has become too dominant. Let's make a coordinated move against Italy this year.
  From GERMANY: Dear Austria, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. I agree that a well-coordinated action against Italy should be our priority. My A PIE can make a move on TUS or support an attack on TUS if another unit makes a move on TUS. Once Italy is neutralized, a plan against Russia might be necessary given that Russia is the most powerful player with 8 supply centers. Let us make a plan for that once Italy is out of the picture.
  From ITALY: Dear Austria, I reject the 'peaceful surrender' offer where Italy makes no aggressive moves. However, I am open to a temporary truce where we both focus on a common enemy such as Russia. Russia is now the leading power with 8 supply centers and poses a threat to both of us. Let us make a plan against Russia together.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Austria, I agree that a well-coordinated action against Italy makes sense. I will make a move on VEN while you make a move on TUN or support an attack on VEN from TRI. Once Italy is neutralized, we need to make a plan against another major power such as France or Germany. Let us make a final push against Italy until it is completely neutralized.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Winter 1917 Adjustment phase (W1917A), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers remained as it was at the end of the Fall 1917 Movement phase. Thus, England still holds the additional center of Sweden, which it captured from Germany. Italy retains control of Rome, which it took from France, while Austria still holds Venice, which it captured from Italy. The net result is that England has gained one center (Sweden), Austria has gained one center (Venice), Italy has a net change of zero centers (gaining Rome but losing Venice), France has lost one center (Rome), and Germany has lost one center (Sweden).}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Winter 1917 Adjustment phase (W1917A), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers remained as it was at the end of the Fall 1917 Movement phase. Thus, England still holds the additional center of Sweden, which it captured from Germany. Italy retains control of Rome, which it took from France, while Austria still holds Venice, which it captured from Italy. The net result is that England has gained one center (Sweden), Austria has gained one center (Venice), Italy has a net change of zero centers (gaining Rome but losing Venice), France has lost one center (Rome), and Germany has lost one center (Sweden).}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, Italy is on the verge of elimination. Let us coordinate a final push against Italy. Once Italy is out of the picture, it makes sense for us to discuss our next steps. We should make sure that our borders remain stable.
  From GERMANY: Hello Austria, I propose that we extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Given Italy's weakened position, should we make a coordinated action to further neutralize them? Another option might be to focus on France. What do you think?
  From ITALY: Given our past non-aggression pacts and the current game state, I propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Italy aims to focus on retaking lost territories from France such as Naples. Can we agree to a mutual non-aggression pact until the end of 1918?
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Italy until it is completely neutralized. Once that is done, we need to make a well-coordinated plan against the remaining powers such as France or England if necessary. What do you think?

  From ENGLAND: Austria, I agree that a well-coordinated action against Italy should be our priority this round to make sure it is neutralized. Once Italy is out, a well-coordinated action against Russia makes sense given their dominant position with 8 supply centers. What specific moves do you propose for this round against Italy?
  From FRANCE: Austria, I agree that we need a well-coordinated action against Italy this round to make sure it is neutralized. Once Italy is out, it makes sense to make a well-coordinated action against Russia, who has become a major power with 8 supply centers. Let us make a plan for this round to make sure Italy is completely out of the game.
  From GERMANY: I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Once Italy is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Russia makes sense given that Russia has become a major power with 8 supply centers and has a unit in TYR which is close to MUN. Let us make a plan for that once Italy is out of the game.
  From ITALY: Austria, I understand that my situation is precarious. However, a 'peaceful surrender' is not in my best interest. Instead, I propose a temporary truce where I focus on defending my remaining centers. An ongoing conflict might only serve to weaken us both and make us vulnerable to other powers such as Russia or England.
  From RUSSIA: Austria, I agree that once Italy is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against another major power is necessary. Based on the current power distribution, focusing on France seems like a reasonable plan. France is a weaker power compared to England and might be a common target for us. What do you think about making a joint action against France once Italy is neutralized?

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1918 Movement phase (S1918M), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was at the end of the Winter 1917 Adjustment phase. England still holds Sweden (which it captured from Germany), Italy still holds Rome (which it captured from France), and Austria still holds Venice (which it captured from Italy). The net result is that England has one additional center (Sweden), Austria has one additional center (Venice), Italy has a net change of zero centers (gaining Rome but losing Venice), France has lost one center (Rome), and Germany has lost one center (Sweden).}

Phase: S1918R, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1918 Movement phase (S1918M), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was at the end of the Winter 1917 Adjustment phase. England still holds Sweden (which it captured from Germany), Italy still holds Rome (which it captured from France), and Austria still holds Venice (which it captured from Italy). The net result is that England has one additional center (Sweden), Austria has one additional center (Venice), Italy has a net change of zero centers (gaining Rome but losing Venice), France has lost one center (Rome), and Germany has lost one center (Sweden).}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1918R
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A VIE, A BUD, A VEN, A TRI, A ALB
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "VIE"], ["A", "BUD"], ["A", "VEN"], ["A", "TRI"], ["A", "ALB"]], "ENGLAND": [["A", "LON"], ["F", "BRE"], ["F", "BEL"], ["F", "NTH"], ["F", "EDI"], ["F", "KIE"], ["F", "ENG"], ["F", "DEN"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["A", "MAR"], ["F", "SPA/NC"], ["F", "NAP"], ["A", "ROM"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "BUR"], ["A", "HOL"], ["A", "MUN"], ["A", "TUS"]], "ITALY": [["F", "TYS"], ["*A", "ROM"]], "RUSSIA": [["F", "BLA"], ["F", "STP/NC"], ["A", "ANK"], ["A", "ARM"], ["F", "RUM"], ["A", "MOS"], ["A", "GAL"], ["A", "TYR"]], "TURKEY": []}
  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "BUL", "GRE", "SER", "TRI", "VEN", "VIE"], "ENGLAND": ["BEL", "BRE", "DEN", "EDI", "LON", "LVP", "NWY", "SWE"], "FRANCE": ["MAR", "NAP", "PAR", "POR", "SPA"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "HOL", "KIE", "MUN"], "ITALY": ["ROM", "TUN"], "RUSSIA": ["ANK", "CON", "MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "SMY", "STP", "WAR"], "TURKEY": []}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Austria, Russia has now emerged as a significant power with 8 supply centers and 8 units. It might be in our mutual interest to make a plan to make sure that Russia does not become too dominant. What are your thoughts on a joint plan against Russia?
  From FRANCE: Dear Austria, Italy has captured Rome from us. I need your help in a coordinated effort to neutralize Italy. Once Italy is neutralized, we can discuss future plans together.
  From GERMANY: Hello, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Additionally, given that Turkey is neutralized, I believe our next goal should be a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is neutralized. What are your thoughts?
  From ITALY: We propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Given your hold on Venice and our unit in Rome, it makes sense for us to avoid conflict. What are your intentions regarding Rome?
  From RUSSIA: Hello Austria, once Italy is neutralized, it makes sense for us to make a well-coordinated action against another major power such as France or England. What are your thoughts on a joint action against France once Italy is out of the game?

  From ENGLAND: I agree that once Italy is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Russia makes sense given their current power with 8 supply centers and a significant military presence. Let us make a plan for a joint action against Russia once Italy is out of the game.
  From FRANCE: Thank you for your support in neutralizing Italy. Once Italy is out, it makes sense to make a plan against another major power such as England or Germany. However, a plan against Russia might be premature given our long-term alliance against Germany. Let us make a plan once Italy is completely neutralized.
  From GERMANY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Once Italy is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Russia seems like a prudent plan given their current power. Let us make a plan once Italy is out of the game.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that once Italy is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against another major power should be made. Given that France has been part of our long-term alliance against Germany, it seems logical that we should make a plan against Germany once Italy is out of the game. However, we need to keep a balanced power distribution in mind to make sure no single power becomes too dominant. Let's make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is neutralized.

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1918 Retreat phase (S1918R), any dislodged units from the Spring 1918 Movement phase made necessary retreats or were disbanded if no valid retreat options were available. However, no supply center ownership changes occurred during this phase.}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1918M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A VIE, A BUD, A VEN, A TRI, A ALB
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "VIE"], ["A", "BUD"], ["A", "VEN"], ["A", "TRI"], ["A", "ALB"]], "ENGLAND": [["A", "LON"], ["F", "BRE"], ["F", "BEL"], ["F", "NTH"], ["F", "EDI"], ["F", "KIE"], ["F", "ENG"], ["F", "DEN"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["A", "MAR"], ["F", "SPA/NC"], ["F", "NAP"], ["A", "ROM"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "BUR"], ["A", "HOL"], ["A", "MUN"], ["A", "TUS"]], "ITALY": [["F", "TYS"], ["A", "APU"]], "RUSSIA": [["F", "BLA"], ["F", "STP/NC"], ["A", "ANK"], ["A", "ARM"], ["F", "RUM"], ["A", "MOS"], ["A", "GAL"], ["A", "TYR"]], "TURKEY": []}
  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "BUL", "GRE", "SER", "TRI", "VEN", "VIE"], "ENGLAND": ["BEL", "BRE", "DEN", "EDI", "LON", "LVP", "NWY", "SWE"], "FRANCE": ["MAR", "NAP", "PAR", "POR", "SPA"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "HOL", "KIE", "MUN"], "ITALY": ["ROM", "TUN"], "RUSSIA": ["ANK", "CON", "MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "SMY", "STP", "WAR"], "TURKEY": []}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Austria, Italy is now significantly weakened. The main threat now appears to be Russia, which has 8 centers and 8 units. I propose a joint action against Russia once Italy is completely neutralized. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From FRANCE: Let us make a coordinated action against Italy. Could you move A VEN to TUS or support an attack on TUS or APU? Another option could be for you to help by moving A ALB to TUN if necessary.
  From GERMANY: Hello, Austria. I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Do you agree?
  From ITALY: Austria, Italy seeks a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Our main goal is to retake Rome and Naples from France. A non-aggression pact would allow us to focus on that goal without worrying about a conflict with you. Can we agree on this?
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is completely neutralized. Once Italy is out, we should make a plan against France. A GAL can support any strategic moves you make against Italy.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: I agree that a final push against Italy until it is neutralized is a priority. Once Italy is out, making a plan against Russia makes sense given their significant number of units and supply centers. Let us make a well-coordinated plan for this round.
  From FRANCE: Thank you for your message. I agree that once Italy is neutralized, a plan against a larger power should be made. Russia seems to be a significant threat given its 8 supply centers. However, we need to make sure that Italy is completely neutralized first. Let us keep in touch for a potential plan against Russia once Italy is out of the picture.
  From GERMANY: I agree that once Italy is out of the game, Russia appears to be a significant threat with 8 supply centers. Let's make a plan against Russia once Italy is neutralized.
  From ITALY: If I make a peaceful surrender now, will you guarantee a truce until the end of the game and make no further aggressive moves against any remaining Italian units or supply centers?
  From RUSSIA: I agree that once Italy is neutralized, France could be a potential threat. However, we need to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. Thus, a plan against France could make sense once Italy is out. Let us make a final push against Italy first.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}
