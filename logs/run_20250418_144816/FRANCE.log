  From ENGLAND: Hello France, I appreciate your proposal for a peaceful arrangement where you focus on the English Channel while I focus on the North Sea. I am open to a non-aggression pact for this turn where neither of us moves into the English Channel. However, for a long-term plan, I believe we need to further discuss how we can mutually benefit from our geographical positions. What are your thoughts on a more structured long-term alliance?
  From GERMANY: Hello France, I agree to a non-aggression pact so that we can focus on other regions. I might focus on the east while you focus on the west. Let us avoid early conflicts and support each other in our respective regions.
  From ITALY: Hello France, I agree to a non-aggression pact where I focus on the Eastern Mediterranean and possibly against Austria while you focus on the north and west. To ensure mutual non-aggression, I suggest that I avoid moving towards the Western Mediterranean and that you avoid moving towards the Italian mainland. How does that sound?

To Italy, confirm the non-aggression pact and ask for their specific plans in the Mediterranean. To Russia, express interest in an alliance against a common threat and ask for a more detailed plan."

  From ENGLAND: I agree to your proposal for a peaceful division of the English Channel where you stay out of the English Channel (ENG) if I stay out of the Mid-Atlantic Ocean (MAO). However, I would like to discuss a more long-term structured alliance where we can support each other against other powers such as Germany or Russia. What are your thoughts on a potential alliance?
  From GERMANY: Greetings France, I agree with your proposal for a non-aggression pact where both of us agree not to attack each other for the first few turns. This will allow us to focus on other potential threats and expand our influence elsewhere. Let us respect each other's borders and work on our respective goals.
  From ITALY: Greetings, France. I agree to a non-aggression pact where you focus on the north while I focus on expanding towards the Balkans or Turkey. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful.

  From ENGLAND: Hello France, I agree that we need to reaffirm our agreement on the peaceful split of the English Channel. It makes sense for us to focus on the North Sea and Scandinavia while you keep a fleet in the English Channel. However, let us make sure that any fleet in the English Channel is used for mutual defense against Germany rather than as a potential threat to us. Germany should indeed remain our priority target.
  From ITALY: Hello, our non-aggression pact is important to me as well. I agree that focusing on Austria makes sense given your plans for Germany and England. Could you share more details on how you plan to handle Germany and England? Additionally, what are your plans for the Mediterranean region? I need to make sure our mutual interests are aligned.
  From RUSSIA: I am interested in a long-term alliance where you focus on Germany while I focus on Austria and Turkey. For now, I suggest that you make moves against Germany while I make moves against Austria and Turkey. This way, we can both make gains in our respective areas of interest. Let us keep in touch and coordinate our actions.

    "arguments": {
      "thought": "Based on the current game state and the previous round of negotiations, it seems that France has been focusing on consolidating its position in Western Europe while trying to maintain a non-aggression pact with England, Germany, and Italy. However, the main goal should be to expand and secure more supply centers. Given that France has units in MAO, BRE, BUR, HOL, and POR, it makes sense to continue focusing on expanding into the English Channel and possibly the Mediterranean. However, a key part of the strategy should be to make sure that Germany is kept in check while trying to make gains against England or Italy if possible. Another important part of the strategy should be to make sure that Russia does not make any aggressive moves against us. 

1. **England**: Since France has a unit in the English Channel (MAO), it makes sense to try to negotiate a peaceful division of the English Channel with England. However, if England does not agree, France should be prepared to make a move against England's units in the North Sea (NTH) and London (LON).

2. **Germany**: The non-aggression pact should be reaffirmed, but France should be cautious and make sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards Belgium or Burgundy. A unit in BUR can be used to keep an eye on Germany's unit in Ruh (RUH).

3. **Italy**: The non-aggression pact should be reaffirmed, and France should make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards Marseilles (MAR) or Spain. However, France should also make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards Austria or Turkey, which could make Italy too strong.

4. **Russia**: Although there was a previous round of negotiation where a non-aggression pact was reaffirmed and a coordinated action against Germany was proposed, it seems that Russia might be more focused on the Eastern part of the map. However, it is important to make sure that Russia does not make any aggressive moves towards Germany if France plans to make a move against Germany.

5. **Austria and Turkey**: Although there was no direct communication mentioned previously, it might be worth reaching out to Austria and Turkey to make sure that they are not making any aggressive moves against France's allies or making any deals that could be detrimental to France's interests.

Based on this reasoning, the plan for this round should be:
- Send a message to England to reaffirm the previous proposal for a joint plan against Germany and to make sure that there is a peaceful division of the English Channel.
- Send a message to Germany to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and make sure that there is a mutual standoff in Belgium.
- Send a message to Italy to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and suggest cooperation in the Mediterranean.
- Send a message to Russia to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and make sure that any coordinated action against Germany is still on the table.
- Update the memory to keep track of the messages sent and the responses received."

Could you provide a more detailed plan on how you plan to make your moves against Germany and what specific support you need from us? For instance, what moves do you plan for your A BUR and A HOL units? We need a well-coordinated plan.
  From GERMANY: Our non-aggression pact still stands. However, the unit in BUR makes me a bit uneasy as it could be seen as a threat to RUH. Can we make a mutual standoff where your A BUR does not make aggressive moves towards RUH while my A RUH stays put or makes a non-threatening move such as A RUH -> BUR (supporting hold)?
  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact is still in place and I am glad to continue our cooperation in the Mediterranean. Any support from your unit in MAO for actions in the Western Mediterranean would be appreciated. Let us make sure our units do not come into conflict.

\boxed{"In the Fall 1902 Movement phase, despite the active deployment of new units built previously by France, England, Turkey, Italy, Austria, and Russia, no supply centers changed hands. This suggests that the powers may have been engaged in strategic maneuvers or defensive actions that did not result in the capture of any new territories. The phase thus appears to be a continuation of the previous one where the focus was on consolidating positions and making strategic moves without immediate territorial gains."}

  From ITALY: Dear France, it seems that no supply centers changed hands in the Fall 1902 Movement phase. Given our non-aggression pact, I want to reaffirm our peaceful intentions and seek your thoughts on any future plans. Previously, we proposed a joint action against Austria which might help us both gain strategic advantages. What are your thoughts on coordinating moves in the next round?

  From AUSTRIA: Hello France, thank you for your message. My main focus is currently on the Balkans and Eastern Europe. However, I am open to finding ways to cooperate where our interests align. Let us keep a line of communication open for future opportunities.
  From ENGLAND: Hello France, thank you for your message. I agree that our alliance should remain strong. The unit in KIE is a significant strategic move against Germany. Let's plan a coordinated attack on Germany. What specific support do you need from me? However, once Germany is defeated, I propose that we make sure that Russia does not become a threat. What are your thoughts on that?
  From GERMANY: Hello France. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, the presence of your unit in KIE is a significant concern. A true non-aggression pact should perhaps involve a French retreat from KIE. I hope that we can continue to maintain a peaceful border once this issue is resolved.
  From ITALY: Hello, France. I agree that no new supply centers were captured last round. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and am open to continuing our cooperation in the Mediterranean. My plans for next year involve reinforcing my position in the Adriatic and possibly building a new fleet in Naples to make moves in the Ionian Sea. Any mutual actions against Austria or Turkey could be beneficial.
  From RUSSIA: Hello France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and long-term alliance where you focus on Germany while I focus on Austria and Turkey. For the next year, I plan to continue pressuring Austria and Turkey while you should make moves against Germany. Let us keep each other informed.
  From TURKEY: Hello, thank you for reaching out. I am open to exploring ways we can cooperate where our interests align. Given our geographical distance, what specific plans did you have in mind for collaboration?

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I agree that our joint plan against Germany should be reaffirmed. F ENG will support F BRE if it needs to hold position or move strategically such as to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean (MAO) if it makes sense for our alliance. However, I need to make sure that F ENG primarily holds the English Channel to prevent any unexpected moves. F NTH could indeed be used to support any strategic moves against Germany. Let us coordinate closely.
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and mutual standoff in Belgium. However, your army in KIE is a direct threat to Berlin. It would be in the spirit of our non-aggression pact for you to move A KIE elsewhere such as to HOL or DEN if possible. This would help us maintain a peaceful border. Let us keep our agreement intact and focus on other threats such as England or Italy.
  From ITALY: Dear France, thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. Your suggestion for a joint action against Germany sounds interesting. However, A VIE might be needed for defense against potential threats from Austria or Russia. However, we are open to keeping an eye on Munich and will work together if the situation allows. Let us stay in touch.
  From RUSSIA: I acknowledge your proposal for a coordinated action against Germany. For now, our main focus is on Turkey and Austria, but I am open to a long-term alliance. A MOS could move to WAR if you make a coordinated move against Germany. However, we need a solid plan for such an action to make sure it does not leave us vulnerable elsewhere.

  From GERMANY: Dear France, I see that you currently hold KIE, which is a home supply center for Germany. I would like to propose that you move your unit out of KIE so that Germany can retake it. We have a non-aggression pact and should focus on other regions such as England or Italy. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given that we both have interests in the Mediterranean, is there any way we can cooperate further? Perhaps a joint action against Austria could be beneficial for us both.

  From GERMANY: Dear France, I am concerned about your unit in KIE. It seems that a strong France is a threat to both of us. I propose that you focus on England and Italy while I focus on Russia and Austria. Could you make a non-aggressive move such as supporting a German unit elsewhere or moving your unit out of KIE? Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and work together against common threats.
  From ITALY: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given your strong position, would you be interested in coordinating actions against Germany or any other power? Additionally, any cooperation in the Mediterranean would be beneficial for us both.
  From RUSSIA: Let us continue our long-term alliance where you focus on Germany while I focus on Austria and Turkey.

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, we need a well-coordinated plan for the English Channel. Moving F ENG to NTH is not feasible as F NTH already occupies that sea. Moving F ENG to SKA would make us vulnerable in the English Channel. A possible alternative could be moving F ENG to IRISH SEA if you need access to ENG for a specific plan. However, another part of your message mentions a joint plan if Germany vacates Belgium. However, Belgium is currently under your control, so could you clarify what you mean? Let us make a plan where both of us gain strategic advantages against Germany.
  From GERMANY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. I agree that maintaining a peaceful border is important. However, I have concerns about your unit in Holland (A HOL) being so close to my unit in Burgundy (A BUR). I hope that you make no aggressive moves against KIE or BER. Let us focus on our respective goals while keeping our borders peaceful.
  From ITALY: I confirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I am open to a cooperative stance in the Mediterranean. However, my main focus is on the Balkans and Turkey. Any action against Austria should be well-coordinated so that I can secure some of Austria's remaining centers such as BUD, GRE, or SER. However, I am primarily focused on countering Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, I agree that a coordinated action against Germany could be beneficial. I plan to make a move against Germany's A WAR with A MOS if you make a coordinated move against Germany. Let us keep in touch.

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, our alliance against Germany seems to be working well so far. What are your plans for the next year (Winter 1903 builds and Spring 1904 moves)? How can England support you further against Germany? Let us continue to coordinate closely.
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. However, I am concerned about your unit in A HOL and the fact that you hold KIE. I propose that you move A HOL to BEL (if possible) and do not make any aggressive moves towards BER or MUN. It would be beneficial for us if you vacate KIE so that I can retake it. Let us focus on our respective goals and avoid any conflicts.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. France seems strong in the west. Are you interested in a joint action against Germany to reduce their influence?
  From RUSSIA: FRANCE, the situation in the Balkans is progressing well with Austria capturing BUL from Turkey. How is your front against Germany? We should continue our long-term alliance where you focus on Germany while I focus on Austria and Turkey.

  From ENGLAND: Our joint plan against Germany seems to be making good progress. I suggest that we continue our coordinated actions. For the next round, I propose that F ENG could support F BRE if necessary, while F NTH could support any potential French moves into the North Sea or against German units. A YOR could be used to support any land-based actions against Germany if necessary. What specific targets do you have in mind for a joint attack on Germany?
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and agree on a mutual standoff in Belgium and Burgundy. However, I am concerned about your unit in Holland (A HOL) and your control of KIE. It makes sense for us to keep a stable border, but I need a clear understanding of your intentions in the region. Can we agree that you will not make any aggressive moves towards my territories such as Munich or Berlin?
  From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My main focus is currently on Turkey. However, I would be open to a joint action against Austria if you make a specific proposal. Let us keep in touch.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, I acknowledge your proposal for a joint action against Germany or Turkey. My current strategy is to focus on Turkey until the situation in the south is resolved. Once Turkey is sufficiently weakened, a joint action against Germany could be a viable plan where you attack from the west while I make a move from the east. Let us keep in touch and support each other.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

To maintain a balance, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact, specifically for the English Channel. What are your thoughts on continuing our joint focus on Germany? However, I would like to make sure that your growing strength does not bring any aggressive intentions towards me.
  From GERMANY: Dear France, it is important that our non-aggression pact remains intact. However, I need clarification on your intentions regarding the unit in A HOL and the supply center KIE. Could you assure me that you are not planning any aggressive moves against Germany? We need to make sure that our borders remain secure so that we can focus on our respective goals.
  From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. My main focus is currently on Turkey. However, if you have any specific proposals against another power (such as Austria or Germany), I am open to discussing them.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, your expansion and current power are impressive. I want to reaffirm our long-term alliance where you focus on Germany while I focus on the south. However, any aggressive moves should be well-coordinated so that no single power becomes too dominant. What are your plans for the coming moves?

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1904M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, your plan against Germany seems reasonable. However, it's important for us to make sure that our actions do not make one of us too dominant. I can support your F BRE into ENG with F NTH and F ENG this round. However, for future rounds, we need a plan that makes sure both of us make balanced gains. I am also open to supporting your F BRE into ENG this round if you agree to support my F ENG into BEL in the next round. Additionally, I am hesitant to make a move with F SKA yet until we have a more concrete plan against Germany where both of us make gains.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure you that any defensive moves are only in response to perceived threats. I have no intention of moving against A HOL in Belgium and would prefer to keep the peace on that front while focusing on other matters such as the Russian front. However, it is important that you do not make any aggressive moves towards my units such as A BUR.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My main focus this year will be on Turkey. However, if you have a specific proposal for a joint action against Austria, I am open to hearing it. However, the main priority for us should be to keep Germany in check.
  From RUSSIA: I agree to make a coordinated action against Germany where I will make a move from A MOS to attack WAR. I hope you make a move such as A PAR to BUR or another coordinated move against Germany.

  From ENGLAND: Hello, we should continue our joint plan against Germany. F NTH can support A HOL - KIE if that's your plan for A HOL. F ENG should stay in place to support F BRE in case of any defensive needs. However, if F BRE makes a move, F ENG can support it. Let's keep up the pressure on Germany.
  From GERMANY: Hello France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I agree that A BUR should make a move that does not threaten A PAR. However, A BUR could move to RUH only if you agree to remove A HOL from KIE or make a non-aggression commitment towards our home centers such as BER and MUN. We need to make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My main focus is currently on Turkey and possibly Austria. I need to keep Germany as a non-aggression partner until 1905, so I am not in a position to support you against Germany at this time. However, once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss potential joint actions against other powers.
  From RUSSIA: Hello France, our non-aggression pact still stands. However, my main focus for now is on neutralizing Turkey. Once that is done, a coordinated action against Germany could be considered.

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, while we have maintained a non-aggression pact, your growing strength is a concern. We need to make sure that our alliance remains balanced and that other powers do not feel threatened. What are your plans for the Fall 1904 moves phase? I suggest that we need to make a plan that ensures a balanced power distribution on the board.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I am concerned about your A HOL unit in KIE. I suggest that my A BUR could move to RUH if you agree to remove A HOL from KIE or make a non-aggression commitment. My main focus is on the east (Russia), so a stable western border would be beneficial for both of us.
  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 still stands. I am currently focusing on Turkey and possibly Austria. Any joint action against Austria could be beneficial once Turkey is neutralized. Let us keep our lines of communication open.
  From RUSSIA: We reaffirm our long-term alliance. However, our immediate priority is to neutralize Turkey first. Once that is done, a coordinated action against Germany could be made. For now, let us make sure that Turkey is dealt with.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Let's keep up the pressure on Germany. My plan for F ENG is to stay put or support any necessary actions against Germany, while F NTH could be used to support any actions against A HOL or F BRE if needed. Let us keep our communication open and make sure our units are well-coordinated.
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A HOL should stay where it is unless there are any aggressive moves. My plans for A BUR and A RUH are primarily defensive. A BUR could stay where it is unless there is a need to make a defensive move such as moving to RUH if A HOL makes a move. A RUH could stay where it is unless there is a need to make a defensive move such as moving to KIE if there is a threat from another power. Let us keep our borders secure.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My units A BOH and A TYR are primarily for defensive purposes against Germany and to support any potential action against Turkey. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I might be open to future cooperation against Germany.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, I reaffirm our long-term alliance. For now, my main focus is on neutralizing Turkey. Once Turkey is neutralized, a coordinated action against Germany could be beneficial. A GAL could be used to make a move against Germany if needed, such as supporting a potential move to BOH or WAR. However, the main focus should be on Turkey for now.

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 moves phase, there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in Fall 1904, where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria, thus resulting in a swap of these two supply centers between the two powers, persisted through this phase. The lack of center changes indicates that no new captures or significant territorial shifts occurred during this phase.}

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 moves phase, there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in Fall 1904, where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria, thus resulting in a swap of these two supply centers between the two powers, persisted through this phase. The lack of center changes indicates that no new captures or significant territorial shifts occurred during this phase.}

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, while I understand your need to regain control of Belgium, it is crucial for us to maintain a strategic position there to keep a balance of power. However, I am open to discussing a more structured plan where we work together against Germany. Let us make sure that our fleets in the North Sea and English Channel (although I currently do not have a fleet in the English Channel) do not come into conflict. However, for now, it makes strategic sense for us to hold on to Belgium until a more stable plan is in place. Let us continue to make coordinated moves against Germany.
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact as well. However, A BUR is part of a defensive strategy against potential threats from other powers such as Italy or England. However, if you make a move that threatens Germany (e.g., moving A HOL to KIE), A BUR might need to act defensively. I hope we can maintain our peaceful relations.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. I am focusing on Turkey and Austria and appreciate your peaceful intentions. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, our long-term alliance has indeed been beneficial. However, with the current board situation, a coordinated action against Germany makes strategic sense. I plan to make a move on Warsaw with A MOS to WAR. However, we need to make sure that all powers on the board are balanced so that no single power dominates.

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 retreats phase (S1905R), there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in the Spring 1905 moves phase remained the same, indicating that no units were dislodged or required retreats. The game state thus continues to reflect the territorial changes from the Fall 1904 phase where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria.}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1905M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: F GAS, F BRE, A HOL, A PAR, F MAR, A SPA, F MAO

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: France, while we have maintained a non-aggression pact, your growing strength is a concern. We need to make sure that our alliance remains balanced and that other powers do not feel threatened. What are your plans for the Fall 1905 moves phase?
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. However, I am concerned about your unit in HOL. To avoid any conflict, I propose that you move A HOL to KIE (which is your supply center) and I will also move A RUH to KIE. This way, we can make a bounce in KIE and avoid any actual conflict. Alternatively, if you could move A HOL to another location such as BEL, that would also help us maintain our non-aggression pact.
  From ITALY: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. Let us maintain peace on our borders.
  From RUSSIA: Our long-term alliance against Germany seems to be working well. How should we coordinate our actions this round? Your strength is growing, and I believe it is important for us to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant on the board.

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I understand your need for Belgium, but it is crucial for us to maintain a strategic position there while we continue our coordinated moves against Germany. However, I am open to discussing a plan where we make a joint move against Germany's northern territories such as SWE or BER. Let us keep up the pressure on Germany together.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. A BUR is primarily for defensive purposes. I understand your concern about A BUR threatening Paris and suggest that it could be used for a defensive position or directed elsewhere if you make a move on another front such as against Italy or Russia. Let us work together on a joint action against Italy or Russia if that makes strategic sense for us both.
  From ITALY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. A joint action against Germany could be a strategic move where I make a move on MUN while you make a move on BUR. However, my main focus for now is on resolving the situation with Turkey. Once that is settled, I am open to a joint action against Germany.
  From RUSSIA: I appreciate your proposal for a long-term alliance and a coordinated action against Germany where A MOS could make a move on WAR while you make a move on BUR. However, my main focus currently is on stabilizing the southern front against Turkey. Once that is done, we can make a strategic move against Germany.

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1905 moves phase (F1905M), there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation thus remains consistent with the state established in the Spring 1905 retreats phase (S1905R), where Turkey had captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria. The game state thus continues to reflect the same distribution of supply centers as previously described.}

  From ENGLAND: France, while we have maintained a non-aggression pact, your growing strength is a concern. We need to make sure that our alliance remains balanced and that other powers do not feel threatened. What are your plans for the next moves? It's important that we keep a balanced board.
  From GERMANY: France, I see that you hold the KIE supply center yet I still have an army in Kiel. Can you clarify your intentions for the next round? Given that you are currently the largest power with 8 supply centers, what are your thoughts on a potential alliance to ensure stability?
  From RUSSIA: Our long-term alliance against Germany seems crucial given your current strength. Once Turkey is neutralized, a coordinated action against Germany makes sense. What are your plans for the next round?

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, our joint plan against Germany has indeed been working well so far. However, maintaining a strategic position in Holland is crucial for our continued efforts against Germany. Unfortunately, I cannot make a move that would allow your dislodged army to retreat to Belgium. However, if Belgium is the only viable retreat option, it should be taken. If you feel that disbanding the unit is a better strategic choice, that should be considered as well. Let us continue our cooperation against Germany until a more stable situation is reached.
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I also value our non-aggression pact. However, your control of KIE makes us a bit nervous as well. I hope that you can understand that A BUR is primarily for defensive purposes. To strengthen our partnership, could we discuss a peaceful transfer of KIE back to Germany? This would help us focus on our mutual enemies.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I agree that our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905 has been a great success. I am open to continuing our non-aggression pact and making a joint plan against Austria once I resolve my situation with Turkey. What are your thoughts on this?
  From RUSSIA: I agree that a coordinated action against Germany should be our next step once Turkey is neutralized. For now, my units in Galicia and Ukraine are focused on the southern front. Once that is secure, we can make a plan to put pressure on Germany.

Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: RETREAT / OTHER
CRITICAL: Submit orders appropriate for this phase type (e.g., Retreat or Disband for units needing retreats). Consult rules.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

\boxed{During the Winter 1905 adjustment phase (W1905A), no supply centers changed ownership. Based on the previous phase, Germany, England, Austria, and Italy were able to build one unit each due to each gaining a new supply center. Conversely, France had to disband two units due to losing Holland and Kiel, while Turkey needed to disband one unit after a net loss of one supply center.}

I currently need to focus on resolving the situation with Turkey. Once that is dealt with, I am open to discussing any joint plans for future turns.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Hello, France. Your plan to make a stronger push against Germany makes sense. I agree that I should focus on the northern territories such as Denmark or Kiel while you focus on attacking from the south such as BUR or MUN. Let us make a coordinated effort against Germany this turn.
  From GERMANY: Hello, France. We are open to renewing the non-aggression pact for 1906. However, A BUR needs to stay where it is for defensive purposes. We want to make it clear that A BUR will not make any aggressive moves against Paris unless we are provoked. We aim to focus our efforts on Russia and Italy. What are your plans for the west?
  From ITALY: I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. It makes sense for us to focus on different fronts. I will focus on Austria and Turkey while you focus on Germany. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I might need to re-evaluate my strategy based on the actions of Germany and other powers.
  From RUSSIA: Hello, France. I agree that our long-term alliance has been beneficial. I am open to a coordinated action against Germany where I can put pressure from the east. For instance, I can move A GAL to WAR while you attack from the west. However, I need to make sure that Austria and Italy do not make any aggressive moves against me while I am focusing on Germany.

  From GERMANY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, any aggressive moves such as moving F ENG into BEL should be avoided. I suggest that you focus on other regions such as Spain or Italy. Let us keep our borders peaceful.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I propose that we continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. I am currently focused on resolving the situation with Turkey. Once that is done, I am open to discussing future plans.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, I want to reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany. A coordinated action where A GAL moves to WAR while you attack from the west could be a good plan. Let us make sure that we make coordinated moves against Germany.

Phase: F1906M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear France, we appreciate your message and hope our relations remain amicable as well. Currently, our main focus is on neutralizing Turkey. However, we will keep an eye on Germany and support you where possible. Once Turkey is out of the picture, we might be able to provide more direct support against Germany.
  From ENGLAND: France, our joint plan against Germany seems to be working well. I agree that keeping the pressure on Germany is a priority. F BEL will hold its position for now and could support any move you make into BUR or RUH. However, we should keep an eye on Italy as they now have 7 supply centers and might be a growing threat once their situation with Turkey stabilizes. Let's make sure our alliance remains strong and well-coordinated.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. A BUR is there for defensive purposes and will not make any aggressive moves against your territories such as PAR or GAS unless provoked. However, A BUR should stay where it is for now unless there is a mutual agreement for a strategic move.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. I acknowledge your suggestion for a coordinated move against Germany where I make a move on MUN. However, my main focus is currently on resolving the situation with Turkey. Once that is resolved, I could make a move against Germany together with you.
  From RUSSIA: I acknowledge your proposal for a coordinated action against Germany. However, our immediate focus should be on eliminating Turkey. Once that is done, we can make a coordinated attack on Germany.
  From TURKEY: We appreciate your message and assure you that our main focus is on Austria and possibly Italy if necessary. We aim to maintain a neutral stance towards France and hope that your efforts against Germany are successful.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Winter 1906 adjustments phase (W1906A) saw no changes in the ownership of supply centers. The results from the Fall 1906 movement phase thus remained in effect, where England gained Belgium from France, Turkey reclaimed Constantinople from Austria while losing Smyrna to Italy, and Italy captured Smyrna from Turkey and Serbia from Austria. Consequently, England's total supply centers increased by one, Italy gained two new centers, Turkey had a net gain of one center, while France lost one center and Austria lost two centers.}

  From ENGLAND: France, Italy has become the largest power on the board with 9 units and 9 supply centers. Given that you have 5 units and 5 supply centers, it might be in our mutual interest to form a temporary alliance against Italy. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb Italy's expansion?
  From GERMANY: Hello, France. I want to make sure that our non-aggression pact is still valid. My army in Burgundy is there for defensive purposes only. However, I need to make sure that your fleets in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean and the English Channel are not a threat to my interests. Can we agree to keep our borders secure and focus on other regions?
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. I hope we can maintain peace and cooperation on our borders.
  From RUSSIA: Our long-term alliance against Germany has been effective. However, Italy's growing power (9 SCs) makes them a significant threat. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a plan to contain Italy's expansion.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Hello, France. While reaffirming our alliance against Germany makes sense, we need to also acknowledge that Italy has now become a significant threat with 9 supply centers. Let's make a plan where we both make a coordinated effort against Germany while keeping an eye on Italy's movements. As for Belgium, it is strategically important for us. Any deal regarding Belgium should be very beneficial for us. What specific actions do you propose for this round?
  From GERMANY: To FRANCE: I agree that our non-aggression pact has been beneficial for us both. I am open to renewing this pact for the year 1907. It makes sense for us to keep our borders peaceful while focusing on other threats such as Italy. My army in BUR is for defensive purposes only.
  From ITALY: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that a coordinated action against Germany makes sense once Turkey is neutralized. However, given Italy's current power with nine supply centers, a coordinated action against Italy should also be considered once Turkey is out of the game.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Spring 1907 movement phase (S1907M) followed a Winter 1906 adjustments phase that saw no changes in supply center ownership. However, during the Fall 1906 phase, England had captured Belgium from France, Italy had taken Smyrna from Turkey and Serbia from Austria, while Turkey had reclaimed Constantinople from Austria. This resulted in England gaining one additional supply center, Italy gaining two, Turkey having a net gain of one, while France lost one and Austria lost two supply centers. The Spring 1907 movement phase itself did not result in any changes in ownership of supply centers, so the distribution of supply centers remained as it was after the Winter 1906 adjustments phase.}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: France, Italy has emerged as the most dominant power with 9 supply centers while you have 5. It makes sense for us to form a temporary alliance against Italy to balance the power distribution. What are your thoughts on a joint plan against Italy for the Fall 1907 phase?
  From GERMANY: Hello France, I want to check in and make sure that our non-aggression pact still holds. What are your plans for the next round? We need to make sure that our borders remain secure.
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. Once the Turkey situation is resolved, I am open to discussing potential actions against Germany or England.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany. Once Turkey is neutralized, we need to make a plan to address Germany. What are your thoughts on a future coordinated action against Germany?

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I agree that continuing our joint efforts against Germany makes sense. However, I need to make sure that F ENG does not make any moves that could threaten my home centers such as LON or LVP. I propose that F BEL should hold position or make a move that does not conflict with F ENG, such as moving to HOL if it makes strategic sense. I am open to supporting your F ENG to hold position if you can assure me that it will not make any aggressive moves against my home centers.
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I acknowledge your concern about A PIC. As a gesture of good faith, I am willing to move A PIC to BUR and reaffirm our non-aggression pact for the remainder of 1907. A strong Germany-France alliance could help us balance against the growing threat from Italy.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. A joint plan against Germany could be beneficial once I have resolved the situation with Turkey. Until then, let us keep our borders secure and maintain our current non-aggression pact.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, I acknowledge our long-term alliance and your proposal for a coordinated action against Germany. However, Italy's growing power makes them a significant threat that needs to be addressed first. Once Italy is contained, I am open to revisiting our plan against Germany.

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Fall 1907 movement phase did not result in any changes in the ownership of supply centers among the remaining powers (England, Italy, Turkey, France, and Austria). Therefore, the distribution of supply centers remained as follows: England with 12 centers, Italy with 7, Turkey with 3, France with 3, and Austria with 1 center until the next phase, which would be the Winter 1907 adjustments phase where any new captures from the Fall 1907 movement phase would be processed (which in this case, there were none).}

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Fall 1907 movement phase did not result in any changes in the ownership of supply centers among the remaining powers (England, Italy, Turkey, France, and Austria). Therefore, the distribution of supply centers remained as follows: England with 12 centers, Italy with 7, Turkey with 3, France with 3, and Austria with 1 center until the next phase, which would be the Winter 1907 adjustments phase where any new captures from the Fall 1907 movement phase would be processed (which in this case, there were none).}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: France, Italy has emerged as a significant threat with 7 supply centers. Given that you now have only 3 supply centers, it might be in our mutual interest to form a temporary alliance against Italy. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb Italy's expansion?
  From GERMANY: Hello, France. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Our units A BUR and A PIC are for defensive purposes only. We need to make sure that we do not make any aggressive moves against each other. What are your plans for the next round?
  From ITALY: We should maintain our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. Once we resolve the situation with Turkey, I might need your support against other potential threats.
  From RUSSIA: Hello, France. Given that both of us have a smaller number of supply centers compared to England and Italy, I propose a new alliance against England and Italy. We need to make a coordinated effort to check their growing power. What are your thoughts on this?

  From ENGLAND: Hello, France. Our joint plan against Germany is still on track. It is important that our units do not make any aggressive moves against each other. Let us continue to focus on Germany and make sure that our borders remain peaceful. However, once Germany is fully contained, we should make a plan for a peaceful division of territories.
  From GERMANY: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. The unit in Picardy is not intended for any aggressive moves against Paris. We need to make sure that our borders remain peaceful. Let us focus on other threats such as Italy and England.
  From ITALY: Hello France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. It is important that our borders remain peaceful and that we avoid any aggressive moves against each other. Let us continue to maintain this peace.
  From RUSSIA: Hello France, I agree that our long-term alliance should be reaffirmed. However, given Italy's growing power, once Turkey is neutralized, a coordinated action against Italy might be more urgent. What do you think about a joint action against Italy after dealing with Turkey?

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: RETREAT / OTHER
CRITICAL: Submit orders appropriate for this phase type (e.g., Retreat or Disband for units needing retreats). Consult rules.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

  From ENGLAND: France, although we have had our differences, it seems that Italy now holds 7 centers and is the most dominant power on the board. It might be in our mutual interest to make a temporary alliance against Italy. What are your thoughts on a coordinated effort against Italy this year?
  From GERMANY: France, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. Our focus should remain on other regions where we face more pressing threats. Can we continue this pact?
  From ITALY: Let us extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. Italy remains focused on resolving the situation in the east with Turkey. Once that is settled, we could discuss potential joint actions against other powers if necessary.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, I reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany and plan a potential joint action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. What are your thoughts on this plan?

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I agree that F ENG should remain in the English Channel for now to avoid any conflicts. Let us continue to put pressure on Germany and make sure our units are well-coordinated. What specific actions do you plan against Germany this round?
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. A PIC and A BUR will not make aggressive moves against A PAR or F MAR. However, these units might be used for defensive purposes or against other powers such as Italy if that makes strategic sense for us.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. Rest assured that A BOH is not intended for any aggressive action towards your A PAR unit. Our main focus is currently on the southern front against Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: I appreciate our long-term alliance against Germany. However, Italy is currently the most dominant power on the board. Once we neutralize Italy, we can make a coordinated action against Germany. For now, any actions you can take to pressure Italy would be helpful.

    "thought": "The reasoning process has been correctly outlined based on the given game state and the messages received. The main goal here is to make strategic moves while maintaining alliances and non-aggression pacts. The plan for this round should be well-considered and make sure that all units are utilized effectively. Another important part is that all units should be assigned one order each. Based on the reasoning, the plan is as follows:

1. A PAR should hold because there are German units in BUR and PIC, and a non-aggression pact until the end of 1908 is in place with Germany.
2. F MAR should move to LYO (Gulf of Lyon) to make a strategic advance towards Italy if needed.
3. F MAO should support A POR moving into SPA to secure that territory.
4. F ENG should hold in the English Channel as agreed with England.
5. A POR should move to SPA supported by F MAO.

The order submission thus should be:
1. A PAR H
2. F MAR - LYO
3. F MAO S A POR - SPA
4. F ENG H
5. A POR - SPA

This plan makes sense given the current alliances and strategic aims described in the messages."

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring of 1908, no supply centers changed ownership. Thus, the distribution of supply centers remains the same as it was at the end of the Winter of 1907: Turkey still holds 4 supply centers, Austria has 2 supply centers, and Italy retains 5 supply centers. The phase did not result in any significant changes to the current state of the game."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: France, with Italy holding a dominant position with 6 to 7 supply centers, it might make sense for us to make a joint plan against Italy. What are your thoughts on a coordinated effort to curb Italy's expansion?
  From GERMANY: Hello France, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful and that we can focus on other threats.
  From ITALY: I want to reassure you that A BOH is not a threat to A PAR. My main focus is on Turkey. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to discussing future cooperation.
  From RUSSIA: Italy has become the most dominant power with 7 supply centers. We need to focus on Italy first. What actions can you take to help us in the Mediterranean?

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I agree that our joint plan against Germany has been effective so far. However, I believe that Italy now poses a significant threat with 7 supply centers. It might be beneficial for us to also consider a plan to check Italy's power while continuing to put pressure on Germany. What are your thoughts on this?
  From GERMANY: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. Units in Picardy and Burgundy are for defensive purposes only and I have no aggressive intentions towards France. A PIC could move to another location such as Gascony or back to Belgium if that makes you feel more secure. Let us make sure that there are no aggressive moves from your part either.
  From ITALY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. I agree that focusing on Austria or Turkey makes strategic sense for now. I am open to discussing a joint action against Germany once the situation with Turkey is resolved. For now, let us keep our non-aggression pact intact.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, I acknowledge our long-term alliance against Germany. However, Italy is now a more immediate threat due to its dominant position. I propose that once Italy is neutralized, a coordinated action against Germany could be more effective. For now, let us make a joint effort against Italy.

Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

        "tool_name": "log_thought",
        "arguments": {
            "thought": "Based on the current game state, my units are:

- A PAR
- F MAR
- F MAO
- F ENG
- A POR

Based on the messages received:

1. England suggests that Italy poses a significant threat and suggests that France and England should consider a plan to check Italy's power while continuing to pressure Germany.
2. Germany reaffirms a non-aggression pact until the end of 1908 and mentions that A PIC could move to another location such as Gascony or back to Belgium if it makes France feel more secure.
3. Italy thanks France for reaffirming the non-aggression pact until the end of 1908 and agrees that focusing on Austria or Turkey makes strategic sense, while being open to discussing a joint action against Germany once the situation with Turkey is resolved.
4. Russia suggests that Italy is now a more immediate threat due to its dominant position and proposes that once Italy is neutralized, a coordinated action against Germany could be more effective. Russia suggests making a joint effort against Italy for now.

Based on the current game state, here are some options for each unit:

- A PAR: Options could be to hold in Paris (A PAR H), move to Burgundy (A PAR - BUR), or support other units such as supporting A BUR - PAR if Germany makes an aggressive move (which seems unlikely based on Germany's message). Given that Germany has a unit in Burgundy (A BUR), it might make sense to make a defensive move such as holding or preparing to support another unit.

- F MAR: Options could include holding in Marseilles (F MAR H), moving to the Gulf of Lyon (F MAR - GOL), or moving to Piedmont (F MAR - PIE). Another option could be to support another unit such as to support A PAR if there is a threat from BUR (F MAR S A PAR). A move into GOL might make sense if we need to make a move towards Italy if that is what the other powers suggest.

- F MAO: Can hold (F MAO H), move to Gascony (F MAO - GAS), move to Spain (F MAO - SPA), move to the Western Mediterranean (F MAO - WES), or support another unit such as supporting an attack on Spain if another unit is attacking it (F MAO S F ENG - SPA). However, F ENG should not be ordered to move to SPA as that is not a valid move for a fleet in the English Channel. Another valid support might be to support F ENG if it stays in place or even moves to a valid location like the North Sea (F MAO S F ENG - NTH), though that seems less likely here. A defensive hold might be a safer bet.

- F ENG: Options include holding (F ENG H), moving to the North Sea (F ENG - NTH), moving to the Irish Sea (F ENG - IRI), moving to Brest (F ENG - BRE), or supporting another unit such as supporting another unit's hold in the English Channel (F ENG S F MAO if F MAO stays in MAO). Another possibility is that F ENG might need to support a move to Belgium (F ENG S A PAR - BEL) if there is a plan to attack Belgium.

- A POR: Options include holding (A POR H), moving to Spain (A POR - SPA), or moving to Gascony (A POR - GAS). Another option might be to support another unit such as supporting A PAR (A POR S A PAR). However, a move to Spain might make sense if there is a need to make a defensive move against a potential attack from Italy or any other power.

Based on the messages, a main strategy appears to be a joint action against Germany with England. However, both England and Russia suggest that Italy is now a more immediate threat. However, Italy has reaffirmed its non-aggression pact until the end of 1908 and seems open to a future joint action against Germany once the situation with Turkey is resolved. Hence, it might make sense to continue a joint plan against Germany while keeping an eye on Italy.

However, a more defensive and careful strategy might be prudent here. For instance:

1. A PAR could hold or make a defensive move such as moving to Burgundy (A PAR - BUR) only if supported by another unit such as F MAR supporting (F MAR S A PAR - BUR). However, holding seems a safer move to guard against potential German aggression.
2. F MAR could hold or make a defensive move such as moving to the Gulf of Lyon (F MAR - GOL) to keep an eye on Italy's moves in the Mediterranean.
3. F MAO should hold or make a move that makes sense in guarding against England. However, holding might be a safer bet here until a more specific plan is agreed upon with England.
4. F ENG could hold or support a move such as F ENG S F MAO - NTH if F MAO moves to NTH (which is not a valid move for a fleet in MAO, so this is an incorrect reasoning). A valid support might be F ENG S F MAO H if F MAO holds.
5. A POR could hold or make a move such as A POR - SPA if there is a need to make a defensive move or secure another supply center such as Spain.

Thus, a possible plan might be:

1. A PAR H (hold Paris as a defensive position against a potential move from A BUR).
2. F MAR - GOL (to keep an eye on Italy and make a defensive move in the Mediterranean).
3. F MAO H (hold Mid-Atlantic Ocean to keep control of the sea and be ready for future moves).
4. F ENG H (hold English Channel to maintain control and make sure there is no conflicting move from England).
5. A POR H (hold Portugal to make sure there is no unexpected attack from another direction).

Another part of the plan might be to make a coordinated move against Germany if England is in agreement. However, this seems a bit risky while having a unit in Picardy and Burgundy from Germany. Another more aggressive plan might be to make a move towards Belgium if England agrees.

However, a more balanced plan might be:
1. A PAR - BUR (if Germany agrees to move A BUR out of BUR, such as to RUH or MUN).
2. F MAR - GOL (to make a defensive move in the Mediterranean).
3. F MAO - SPA (to make a move to secure Spain).
4. F ENG H (hold English Channel).
5. A POR S A PAR - BUR (supporting the move of A PAR to BUR).

However, the most cautious and secure plan might be:
1. A PAR H
2. F MAR - GOL
3. F MAO H
4. F ENG H
5. A POR H

However, a more aggressive plan might include:
1. A PAR - BUR (assuming support from A POR and F MAR if needed).
2. F MAR S A PAR - BUR
3. F MAO - SPA
4. F ENG H
5. A POR S A PAR - BUR

However, a more defensive plan might make sense until a more coordinated plan is made with England and Russia.

  From ENGLAND: France, while our primary goal has been to keep pressure on Germany, it seems that Italy has now become the dominant power with 7 supply centers. We need to make a plan to curb their expansion. What are your thoughts on a temporary alliance against Italy once Germany is sufficiently weakened?
  From ITALY: Dear France, I hope our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908 still stands. Once the Turkey situation is resolved, we can discuss future plans.
  From RUSSIA: We acknowledge our long-term alliance against Germany, but Italy has become a significant power. We should focus on Italy first.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I agree that a coordinated attack against Germany once the non-aggression pact expires could be beneficial. However, it seems that Italy has grown significantly and now holds 7 supply centers. We should also consider a plan to check Italy's power. What are your thoughts on a joint plan against Italy once the non-aggression pact with Germany expires?
  From GERMANY: I confirm that our non-aggression pact is valid until the end of 1908. I am open to discussing what our relations could look like post-1908. However, the most pressing issue now seems to be Italy's growing power. Once that is addressed, we can make more long-term plans.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I am willing to extend our non-aggression pact into 1909. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, a joint action against Austria might be a good idea. Let us continue our peaceful relations and plan for a potential joint action against Austria once Turkey is neutralized.
  From RUSSIA: Our long-term alliance against Germany should still be a priority. However, Italy has become a significant threat with 7 supply centers. Once Turkey is neutralized, I suggest we make a plan for a coordinated action against Italy first. What are your thoughts on a joint operation against Italy next year?

\boxed{"During the Winter of 1908 Adjustment phase, Turkey was eligible to build one new unit due to their increased total of 5 supply centers. Austria, now holding only one supply center, had to disband one of their units. Italy maintained their 5 supply centers and thus likely made no unit adjustments.

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter of 1908 Adjustment phase, Turkey was eligible to build one new unit due to their increased total of 5 supply centers. Austria, now holding only one supply center, had to disband one of their units. Italy maintained their 5 supply centers and thus likely made no unit adjustments. No supply centers changed hands during this phase."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: France, with Italy holding 7 supply centers, they have become a significant threat to us both. I propose a temporary alliance to curb Italy's expansion. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan against Italy for this season?
  From GERMANY: I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact for the year 1909 if you are still interested. What are your intentions for this round?
  From ITALY: I propose that we extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. It's important that we maintain a stable relationship while I focus on resolving the situation in the south with Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Italy currently has 7 supply centers and is the most dominant power. Once we make a coordinated action against Germany, it might make sense to first address Italy's growing power. Can we make a joint plan against Italy?

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, your plan to make a move from A PAR to BUR makes sense in the context of coordinating against Germany. However, Italy has now become the strongest power on the board with 7 supply centers. Once Italy resolves their situation with Turkey, they could become a significant threat to us both. It might be wise for us to consider a joint plan against Italy once they have neutralized Turkey. What are your thoughts on this?
  From GERMANY: France, I am open to renewing our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Given the growing power of Italy, which now has 7 supply centers, it makes sense for us to maintain a peaceful border so that we can both focus on other threats.
  From ITALY: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. For now, my main focus is on dealing with Turkey. Once that situation is resolved, a joint action against Germany could be a strategic next step. However, if you have any immediate plans to cooperate against Turkey, please let me know.
  From RUSSIA: France, I agree that our long-term alliance against Germany should be reaffirmed. However, with Italy as the dominant power on the board now, it makes sense to focus on Italy first. Once Turkey is neutralized, a coordinated action against Italy might be needed. A GAL can make moves such as A GAL to WAR if it makes strategic sense once Italy is handled. What do you think?

  From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. I have no aggressive intentions towards you.
  From RUSSIA: France, I reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany. However, once Turkey is neutralized, I believe our focus should shift to Italy. What are your thoughts on this plan?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I agree that we should reaffirm our joint plan against Germany. I will focus on northern Germany such as Kiel and Denmark while you focus on Burgundy and Munich. Let us make sure there is no conflict in the English Channel. Once Germany is sufficiently weakened, we should also keep an eye on Italy, as they currently hold the most supply centers.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact for 1909. A BUR and A PIC are for defensive purposes only and are not intended to threaten Paris. However, I need to make sure that your units also do not make any aggressive moves towards my territories.
  From ITALY: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Currently, our main focus is on dealing with Turkey. However, once that situation is resolved, a joint action against Germany could be a strategic next step.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that our long-term alliance against Germany should remain a priority. However, given that Italy has become the most dominant power with 7 supply centers, it might be wise to first make a coordinated effort against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. Once Italy is under control, we can make a concerted effort against Germany where I can make a move such as A GAL supporting an attack on Munich while you push from the west.

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring of 1909 Retreat phase, no retreats were required because no units were dislodged in the Spring of 1909 Movement phase. The game state thus remains unchanged from the previous phase, with all units staying in their current positions until the next phase, which is the Fall of 1909 Movement phase."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1909M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A PAR, F MAO, F ENG, F LYO, A SPA
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "BUD"], ["A", "SER"]], "ENGLAND": [["F", "SKA"], ["A", "LON"], ["F", "EDI"], ["F", "HOL"], ["F", "HEL"], ["F", "IRI"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["F", "MAO"], ["F", "ENG"], ["F", "LYO"], ["A", "SPA"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "MUN"], ["A", "PIC"], ["A", "KIE"], ["A", "BUR"], ["F", "SWE"], ["A", "TYR"]], "ITALY": [["F", "GRE"], ["A", "VEN"], ["A", "VIE"], ["F", "ROM"], ["F", "AEG"], ["F", "ION"]], "RUSSIA": [["F", "RUM"], ["A", "GAL"], ["A", "SEV"], ["A", "UKR"]], "TURKEY": [["A", "SMY"], ["A", "BUL"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "ANK"]]}
  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "SER"], "ENGLAND": ["BEL", "EDI", "HOL", "LON", "LVP", "NWY"], "FRANCE": ["BRE", "MAR", "PAR", "POR", "SPA"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "DEN", "KIE", "MUN", "SWE", "WAR"], "ITALY": ["GRE", "NAP", "ROM", "TRI", "TUN", "VEN", "VIE"], "RUSSIA": ["MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "STP"], "TURKEY": ["ANK", "BUL", "CON", "SMY"]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: France, Italy now has 7 supply centers and appears to be a significant threat to us all. Given that you have 5 centers and might also feel threatened by Italy's growth, what are your thoughts on a temporary alliance against Italy? A coordinated effort could help us check Italy's expansion.
  From GERMANY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. However, we need to make sure that our units do not make any aggressive moves against each other.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Once the Turkey situation is resolved, I might be open to a joint plan against Germany or another common threat. Let us keep communication open.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany. However, once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a joint action against Italy. What are your plans for the Fall of 1909?

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1909M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Hello, I agree that our joint plan against Germany should continue. I will support your fleet in the English Channel to make a coordinated attack on Kiel. However, we need to make sure that our actions are well-coordinated and that we do not leave any openings for Germany to exploit. What specific moves do you have in mind for your other units?
  From GERMANY: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. The armies in BUR and PIC are for defensive purposes and we have no hostile intentions towards France this round. A BUR could be used to support France if needed against another power such as Italy. A PIC could be used for defensive purposes or to support any joint actions against Italy.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Once the pact expires, I am open to discussing a continued non-aggression or a joint action plan against Germany. However, our immediate focus is on resolving the situation with Turkey. Once that is done, a joint action against Germany could be a strategic next step.
  From RUSSIA: Our long-term alliance against Germany should indeed continue. However, it makes sense for us to make a coordinated action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized as Italy has become the strongest power on the board. For this round, my units are focused on making moves against Turkey.

Phase: S1910M, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Fall of 1909 Movement phase, Austria successfully captured Bulgaria from Turkey. This resulted in Turkey losing control of Bulgaria while Austria gained control of this strategic center."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1910M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A PAR, F MAO, F ENG, F LYO, A SPA
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "BUD"], ["A", "BUL"]], "ENGLAND": [["F", "SKA"], ["A", "LON"], ["F", "EDI"], ["F", "HOL"], ["F", "HEL"], ["F", "LVP"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["F", "MAO"], ["F", "ENG"], ["F", "LYO"], ["A", "SPA"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "MUN"], ["A", "PIC"], ["A", "KIE"], ["A", "BUR"], ["F", "SWE"], ["A", "TYR"]], "ITALY": [["F", "GRE"], ["A", "VEN"], ["A", "VIE"], ["F", "ROM"], ["F", "AEG"], ["F", "ION"], ["F", "NAP"]], "RUSSIA": [["F", "RUM"], ["A", "GAL"], ["A", "UKR"], ["A", "ARM"]], "TURKEY": [["A", "SMY"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "ANK"]]}
  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "BUL", "SER"], "ENGLAND": ["BEL", "EDI", "HOL", "LON", "LVP", "NWY"], "FRANCE": ["BRE", "MAR", "PAR", "POR", "SPA"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "DEN", "KIE", "MUN", "SWE", "WAR"], "ITALY": ["GRE", "NAP", "ROM", "TRI", "TUN", "VEN", "VIE"], "RUSSIA": ["MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "STP"], "TURKEY": ["ANK", "CON", "SMY"]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: France, Italy has become the dominant power on the board with 7 supply centers. Given that you have 5 supply centers, it might be in our mutual interest to form a temporary alliance against Italy. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb Italy's expansion?
  From GERMANY: Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909 has now expired. Would you like to renew it until the end of 1910? Additionally, do you have any concerns about A PIC or A BUR?
  From ITALY: Dear France, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909 is still valid. Once the Turkey situation is settled, a joint plan against Germany could be a strategic next step. Let us keep in touch.
  From RUSSIA: The non-aggression pact with Italy lasts until the end of 1909. Once Turkey is neutralized, I propose that we make a plan for a coordinated action against Italy due to their growing power.

  From ENGLAND: I agree that a coordinated move against Germany makes sense given that our non-aggression pact with them has expired. However, once we make some progress against Germany, a joint action against Italy should be a priority due to their growing power. What specific moves do you propose against Germany?
  From GERMANY: I am open to renewing our non-aggression pact for 1910. However, I need to understand what your other strategic commitments are to ensure that our agreement aligns well. Could you provide more details?
  From ITALY: Dear France, I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to discussing a joint plan against Germany. What are your strategic commitments for the coming year?
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, I understand that your non-aggression pact with Germany has expired. However, our priority should be to first neutralize Turkey. Once Turkey is out of the picture, a joint action against Germany could make sense if Italy is also addressed simultaneously. I believe a coordinated move against Italy should be part of our long-term plan once Turkey is neutralized. What are your thoughts on this plan?

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

  From GERMANY: To France, we reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. Let us maintain our peaceful borders and make sure any strategic moves we make are mutually beneficial.
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. Once Turkey is dealt with, I am open to discussing a joint plan against Germany. What are your thoughts on this?

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I agree that coordinating against Italy makes strategic sense given their dominant position on the board. My F IRI can support any actions you make against Italy's naval presence. Let us work together to secure the Mediterranean and weaken Italy's position. What specific moves do you propose for this round?
  From GERMANY: France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. The units A PIC and A BUR are there for defensive purposes only until the non-aggression pact is in place. Any concerns about unit positions should be addressed explicitly so that we can maintain our peaceful relations.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1910. I am in favor of maintaining our peaceful relations and avoiding conflict. Once the Turkey situation is resolved, I am open to discussing future plans such as a joint action against Germany.
  From RUSSIA: France, our long-term alliance remains strong. I agree that we should continue our coordinated action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. Any moves I make should be supported by your forces where possible. Let us make a plan for the Mediterranean once Turkey is out of the picture.

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter of 1910, no new changes in center ownership occurred. England kept its hold on Denmark, which it had captured from Germany in the Fall of 1910. Russia retained control of Ankara, which it had taken from Turkey in that same Fall phase. Austria continued to hold Bulgaria, a territory it had acquired from Turkey in the Fall of 1909. This phase thus appears to be a period of consolidation for the major powers involved."}

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter of 1910, no new changes in center ownership occurred. England kept its hold on Denmark, which it had captured from Germany in the Fall of 1910. Russia retained control of Ankara, which it had taken from Turkey in that same Fall phase. Austria continued to hold Bulgaria, a territory it had acquired from Turkey in the Fall of 1909. This phase thus appears to be a period of consolidation for the major powers involved."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: France, given that Italy now has 7 supply centers and appears to be a significant threat on the board, it might be in our mutual interest to form a temporary alliance against Italy. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb Italy's expansion? Additionally, I propose that we ensure a non-aggression pact between our two powers while focusing on Italy.
  From GERMANY: Hello. England seems to be the most powerful player right now. Would you be interested in forming an alliance to counter England's dominance?
  From ITALY: Dear France, once we have dealt with Turkey, a joint plan against Germany could be a strategic next step. For now, let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany once Turkey is neutralized. What are your thoughts on this plan?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I agree that Italy has become a major power that needs to be checked. F ENG could support any action that hinders Italy's expansion. F NTH and F DEN should be ready to act against any Italian fleets in the North Sea. Let us make a joint plan against Italy while ensuring that we do not leave ourselves vulnerable to any potential backstabs. What specific actions do you propose for this year?
  From GERMANY: I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. Given Italy's growing power, focusing on other threats such as Italy makes sense for both of us. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful while we address the Italian threat.
  From ITALY: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. It makes sense to keep open communication lines for joint plans against Germany or England once Turkey is dealt with. For now, our main focus is on eliminating Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, it is important that we continue our long-term alliance. I agree that Italy has become a major threat with 7 supply centers. Once Turkey is completely neutralized, a coordinated plan against Italy makes sense. However, for now, let's make sure that Turkey is no longer a threat.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring of 1911, no new changes in center ownership occurred. England maintained its hold on Denmark, which it had captured from Germany in the Fall of 1910. Russia continued to control Ankara, which it had taken from Turkey in the Fall of 1910. Austria still held Bulgaria, a territory it had acquired from Turkey in the Fall of 1909. This phase thus appears to be another period of consolidation for the major powers involved."}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring of 1911, no new changes in center ownership occurred. England maintained its hold on Denmark, which it had captured from Germany in the Fall of 1910. Russia continued to control Ankara, which it had taken from Turkey in the Fall of 1910. Austria still held Bulgaria, a territory it had acquired from Turkey in the Fall of 1909. This phase thus appears to be another period of consolidation for the major powers involved."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: France, while we have maintained a non-aggression pact, your fleet in the English Channel could be seen as a threat to my home centers. Can we make sure that our alliance remains balanced and that your fleet does not pose a threat to my home centers? Additionally, Italy has become a significant threat with 7 supply centers. What are your thoughts on a joint plan against Italy?
  From GERMANY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. We need to make sure that there are no aggressive moves against us.
  From ITALY: Dear France, let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. Once Turkey is dealt with, a joint plan against Germany could be a strategic next step. What are your thoughts on this?
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm the long-term alliance against Germany once Turkey is neutralized. However, we need to make sure that Italy does not become too powerful.

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I agree that our temporary alliance against Italy has been effective. For this fall, I suggest that we continue to put pressure on Italy. My fleet in the Ionian Sea could support your fleet in TYS to move to TYS if needed. Additionally, my fleet in the North Sea could support any actions you need in the English Channel or the North Atlantic. What specific moves do you have in mind for us to work together?
  From GERMANY: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. My main plans for the fall are defensive, and I aim to maintain peaceful relations. However, I am also focusing on the growing threat from Italy.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1911. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Germany could be a strategic next step. Let us make a plan once Turkey is out of the game.
  From RUSSIA: I acknowledge our long-term alliance against Germany once Turkey is neutralized. However, our immediate priority should be to make sure that Turkey is neutralized first. Once that is done, we can plan a joint action against Germany.

  From ENGLAND: France, Italy has become the dominant power with 7 supply centers. It might be in our mutual interest to make a joint plan against Italy. What are your plans for the Spring 1912 moves phase?
  From GERMANY: Hello. I propose renewing our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. What are your strategic plans for this round?
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Once Turkey is dealt with, a joint plan against Germany could be a strategic next step.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1912M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Hello France, I agree that Italy is currently the strongest power with 7 centers. I am willing to join forces against Italy this year. A coordinated plan where I focus from the north and west while you focus on Italy from the west and south makes sense. I will maintain a unit in Holland to keep pressure on Germany while we focus on Italy. What specific moves do you suggest for a coordinated attack?
  From GERMANY: I agree that a new non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 is a good idea. Given Italy's unit in VIE, a joint plan against Italy is strategic. My unit in BUR should remain defensive but could be used for coordination against Italy. Let's keep A BUR for now and make sure we are not vulnerable.
  From ITALY: France, I agree to a new non-aggression pact for 1912. It seems that it might be a good time for us to discuss a long-term strategic plan once Turkey is dealt with. Once this is done, a joint plan against a major power like Germany could be a strategic next step.
  From RUSSIA: Hello France, I agree that Italy now has 7 centers and seems to be a significant threat. I propose that once Turkey is neutralized, we join forces against Italy where I focus on the east while you focus on the west and south. For now, I plan to make a move on Ankara (A CON - ANK) to make a final push against Turkey. What are your plans for this round?

The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it was at the end of Fall 1911, where Germany had captured Belgium from England and Russia had taken Constantinople from Turkey."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear France, Italy is currently the strongest power with 7 supply centers and a significant military presence in the Balkans and the Mediterranean. I am interested in forming a broader alliance against Italy. Your unit in Rome could be used to pressure Italy from the west. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ENGLAND: France, Germany has captured Belgium from us, making them a more immediate threat. However, Italy still has 7 centers and is a significant threat. Let us make a plan to counter Germany's aggression while still focusing on Italy as a long-term threat. What are your thoughts?
  From GERMANY: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Given our alliance with England against you, make sure any moves you make against England are well-coordinated.
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Once the Turkey situation is resolved, a joint plan against Germany could be a strategic next step. However, I need to address the fact that your fleet in Rome is a potential threat to my control over the Italian peninsula. Can we agree that you will not make any aggressive moves against my territories?
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a joint action against Italy where I focus on the east while you focus on the west and south.

Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Thank you for your message. I agree that Italy is a significant threat and that a coalition against them makes sense. However, I need to make sure that Turkey is neutralized first. Once that is done, I am open to making a push against TRI and VIE. Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy once Turkey is out of the game.
  From ENGLAND: France, I agree that we should continue coordinating against Italy this round. My fleets could potentially support actions in the Tyrrhenian Sea or Adriatic Sea. However, the most direct support might come from the North Sea or the English Channel. What specific actions do you need support for from my fleets?
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Once Italy is neutralized, I am open to discussing future plans and a potential joint action against Italy if the situation allows it. Let us keep in touch for further coordination.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Let us keep communication open for future plans once the year concludes. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, we could discuss a joint plan against Germany.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, I agree that the coalition against Italy should be a priority once Turkey is neutralized. After that, our focus should be on Germany. For now, my fleet in ANK will continue to pressure Turkey until it is neutralized.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: France, Germany has captured Belgium from us, making them a more immediate threat. However, Italy still has 7 centers and is a significant threat. Let us make a plan to counter Germany's aggression while still focusing on Italy as a long-term threat. What are your thoughts?
  From GERMANY: Hello France, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. I hope we can continue to maintain peaceful relations.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Once Turkey is dealt with, a joint plan against Germany could be a strategic next step. What are your thoughts?
  From RUSSIA: We need to reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany once Turkey is neutralized. Additionally, a joint action against Italy should be our next priority. What are your thoughts?
  From TURKEY: Dear France, I am reaching out to you in a vulnerable position where I only have one unit (A SMY) and one supply center (SMY). Any support or diplomatic assistance you can provide to help me survive would be highly appreciated. I am open to any suggestions or alliances that might help me make a comeback.

  From ENGLAND: France, I agree that our joint plan against Italy should continue until Turkey is neutralized. For the next moves, I suggest that we need to make a plan such that Italy does not gain any more ground. Let us coordinate our actions for the upcoming year to make sure that Italy does not make any further gains. What specific moves do you propose for the next round?
  From GERMANY: I agree that our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 still stands. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Italy could be a strategic next step. Italy currently holds the most supply centers and poses a significant threat to us both. Let us make a plan to ensure that Italy does not become too powerful.
  From ITALY: I confirm that our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 still stands. Once Turkey is neutralized, we need to make a plan for the next year. Perhaps we could make a joint plan against a common threat such as Germany.

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter 1912 Adjustment phase, England should gain one unit due to its recapture of Belgium from Germany, while Germany should lose one unit because of its loss of Belgium. Similarly, France should gain one unit because it captured Rome from Italy, while Italy should lose one unit due to its loss of Rome. However, no centers changed hands specifically during this phase."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1913M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A PAR, F ENG, A PIE, F ROM, F WES, F BRE
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "BUL"], ["A", "SER"], ["A", "BUD"]], "ENGLAND": [["A", "LON"], ["F", "NTH"], ["F", "EDI"], ["F", "SKA"], ["F", "BEL"], ["F", "BAL"], ["F", "LVP"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["F", "ENG"], ["A", "PIE"], ["F", "ROM"], ["F", "WES"], ["F", "BRE"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "BUR"], ["F", "SWE"], ["A", "TYR"], ["A", "RUH"], ["A", "SIL"]], "ITALY": [["F", "GRE"], ["A", "VEN"], ["A", "VIE"], ["F", "AEG"], ["F", "ION"], ["F", "NAP"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "GAL"], ["A", "SEV"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "BLA"], ["F", "STP/NC"]], "TURKEY": [["A", "SMY"]]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear France, as previously discussed, once Turkey is neutralized, our next target should be Italy. I propose that we make a plan for a joint action against Italy. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From ENGLAND: France, it seems that Italy still poses a significant threat with 6 centers and units. Given that you successfully captured Rome from Italy, it makes sense for us to make a joint plan against Italy again. What are your thoughts on a coordinated effort to keep pressure on Italy?
  From GERMANY: Hello, France. I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. However, given the current power dynamics, it might be beneficial for us to make a plan against a common threat such as England or Italy. What are your thoughts on a potential alliance against England?
  From ITALY: Dear France, I propose a temporary truce or non-aggression pact until the end of 1913 to prevent further losses until a strategic plan can be made. Your capture of Rome has been a significant blow, and I need to make sure that my remaining centers such as Naples and Venice are secure.
  From RUSSIA: Once Turkey is out of the game, we should make a coordinated action against Italy. You can focus on the west and south while I focus on the east.
  From TURKEY: I would like to discuss any potential support or alliance suggestions you might have. Given your strong presence in the Mediterranean, an alliance could help us make gains against a common enemy such as Italy or Russia. Are you open to such a discussion?

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I agree that we should continue our joint plan against Italy until Turkey is neutralized. Let us make a plan to coordinate our attacks on Italy's units and supply centers such as NAP and VEN. Once Turkey is neutralized, we can reassess the situation. What specific moves do you have in mind for this round?
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I agree to a new non-aggression pact for 1913. This will allow us both to focus on other fronts such as Italy and England. Let us make sure our borders are secure and work towards a mutual goal of stability.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I accept your proposal for a new non-aggression pact for 1913. This will allow us both to focus on other fronts. However, I need to mention that retaking Rome will be a priority for me once the situation with Turkey is resolved.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, I agree that we should continue the joint plan against Italy until Turkey is neutralized. Once that is done, we should reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany. Let us make a coordinated plan once Turkey is out.
  From TURKEY: Dear France, I am currently in a dire situation with only one unit and one supply center left. I am seeking alliances against Italy and Russia. Given that you have a significant presence in the Mediterranean, would you be interested in a joint action against Italy or Russia? Any diplomatic support would be highly appreciated.

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring 1913 Movement phase, no centers changed ownership. The territorial control remained stable compared to the previous phase, with England still holding Belgium and France still holding Rome. The overall power distribution among the major powers remained the same as it was at the end of the Winter 1912 Adjustment phase."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1913M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A PAR, F ENG, A PIE, F ROM, F BRE, F TYS

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear France, it seems that you hold ROM which was previously an Italian center. Given that Italy might be a common threat, would you be interested in a joint action against Italy? I am open to any suggestions you might have.
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, Italy still has 6 centers and poses a significant threat. It makes sense for us to continue our joint plan against Italy until they are sufficiently weakened. Given your units in TYS and A PIE, you are well-positioned to make a plan against Italy. What specific moves do you have in mind for this round?
  From GERMANY: Hello, I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. Our units will remain defensive unless necessary for mutual protection.
  From ITALY: We propose a temporary truce until the end of 1913 while we make a final push against Turkey. Once Turkey is neutralized, we can discuss future plans.
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push to eliminate Turkey this round. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a joint action against Italy. After that, we should reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From TURKEY: I am in a very weak position and need any potential support or alliances that could help me survive. Do you have any suggestions or are you open to an alliance against Italy or Russia?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: France, while our current strategic goals might be at odds, it might be beneficial for us to make a temporary truce and focus on another common threat such as Germany or Austria. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
  From GERMANY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. I want to make sure that there are no aggressive moves planned against Germany.
  From ITALY: We need to make a final push against Turkey this round. Our temporary truce until the end of 1913 still holds. However, once Turkey is resolved, we need to make a plan for other strategic moves. Also, we still aim to retake Rome.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, our long-term alliance against Germany should still hold, but Italy is a growing threat. Once Turkey is neutralized, a coordinated action against Italy could make sense. What are your thoughts?
  From TURKEY: I am in a precarious position with only one unit and one supply center remaining. I am seeking any diplomatic support or alliance suggestions you can provide such as putting pressure on RUSSIA or ITALY to ensure the safety of Smyrna.

  From ENGLAND: I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a coordinated action against Italy should be our priority. However, keeping an eye on Germany's actions is also important. Can we make a plan for a joint naval operation against Naples or Tunis? What are your specific thoughts?
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. As for our relationship in 1914, I believe it makes sense to keep our communication open and discuss any potential cooperation once we are closer to the end of the year.
  From ITALY: I acknowledge our temporary truce until the end of 1913. Once the truce ends, it would indeed be prudent to discuss our future relations. For now, our main focus is on resolving the situation with Turkey. Let us keep in touch for future plans for 1914.
  From RUSSIA: Agreed, let us continue our joint plan against Italy until Turkey is neutralized. Once that is done, a coordinated action against Germany seems like a logical next step. However, I also need to make sure that Italy is not a threat once Turkey is out. Any specific plans for a joint action against Italy until Turkey is neutralized?

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers remained as it was at the end of the Fall 1913 Retreat phase, where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy. This phase thus maintained the status quo in terms of supply center distribution."}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers remained as it was at the end of the Fall 1913 Retreat phase, where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy. This phase thus maintained the status quo in terms of supply center distribution."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1914M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A PAR, A PIE, F BRE, F TYS, F MAO, F NAP, A MAR
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "BUL"], ["A", "GRE"], ["A", "VIE"], ["A", "BUD"]], "ENGLAND": [["A", "LON"], ["F", "SKA"], ["F", "BEL"], ["F", "BAL"], ["F", "LVP"], ["F", "ENG"], ["F", "NTH"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["A", "PIE"], ["F", "BRE"], ["F", "TYS"], ["F", "MAO"], ["F", "NAP"], ["A", "MAR"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "BUR"], ["F", "SWE"], ["A", "TYR"], ["A", "RUH"], ["A", "BOH"]], "ITALY": [["A", "VEN"], ["F", "AEG"], ["F", "ION"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "GAL"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "BLA"], ["F", "STP/NC"], ["A", "ARM"]], "TURKEY": [["A", "SMY"]]}
  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "BUL", "GRE", "SER", "VIE"], "ENGLAND": ["BEL", "DEN", "EDI", "HOL", "LON", "LVP", "NWY"], "FRANCE": ["BRE", "MAR", "NAP", "PAR", "POR", "ROM", "SPA"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "KIE", "MUN", "SWE", "WAR"], "ITALY": ["TRI", "TUN", "VEN"], "RUSSIA": ["ANK", "CON", "MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "STP"], "TURKEY": ["SMY"]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: It seems that Italy is our next mutual target once Turkey is completely neutralized. You could make a move on VEN from PIE and perhaps make a naval attack on TUN. What are your plans for Italy?
  From GERMANY: France, I propose that we extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. It seems that this has been beneficial for both of us so far. Do you agree?
  From ITALY: I propose a temporary truce until the end of 1914. We need to focus on other threats such as Germany and England. A truce would allow us both to focus on more pressing matters.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a coordinated action against Germany. However, Italy might also be a significant threat once Turkey is out. Let us keep in touch for a joint plan.
  From TURKEY: I am in a very weak position and need any potential support or alliances against Russia or Austria. Can you provide any support or make a diversionary move against Russia or Austria?

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1914M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: I agree that a final push against Italy makes sense. Once Italy is neutralized, a joint action against Germany could be a good next step. What specific moves do you propose for a coordinated attack on Italy this round?
  From GERMANY: I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. This should allow us to focus on other threats such as Russia or England. However, I need to make sure that any actions I take do not conflict with other strategic commitments.
  From ITALY: I acknowledge that my situation is dire. I am open to a temporary truce where I make no aggressive moves against you if you make no aggressive moves against my remaining units and supply centers. However, I need a guarantee that you will not make any aggressive moves against my remaining units in VEN, AEG, and ION. A peaceful retreat might be a part of this truce until the end of 1914.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a plan against Germany as per our long-term alliance. However, our first priority should be to make a well-coordinated attack on Italy once Turkey is out of the game. After that, we can make a plan against Germany together.
  From TURKEY: I am in a dire situation here. Is there any diplomatic support or distraction moves you could make against Russia or Austria to help me keep Smyrna?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: We need to make a well-coordinated action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. Your units in NAP and PIE could make a move on VEN or TUN. What do you think about a joint action against Italy?
  From ENGLAND: France, it seems that you have made significant gains recently. However, the balance of power is crucial for us all. Let us make a plan to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. What are your intentions for this round?
  From GERMANY: Hello, France. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. I hope we can continue to maintain a peaceful border.
  From ITALY: France, you have captured Naples and dislodged our fleet in the Ionian Sea. However, a prolonged conflict might make us both vulnerable to other powers such as England and Germany. Can we negotiate a temporary truce where you withdraw from Naples and the Ionian Sea?
  From RUSSIA: We reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should plan a coordinated action against Germany. Let us know your thoughts.
  From TURKEY: I am in a very weak position and need any potential support against Russia or Austria. Any diplomatic support you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1914R
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, our joint plan against Italy seems to be working well. Once Italy is fully neutralized, a coordinated action against Germany makes sense given that our non-aggression pact with Germany ends at the end of 1914. However, we need to make sure that any plan against Germany does not make us vulnerable elsewhere. What specific moves do you have in mind for a coordinated action against Germany?
  From GERMANY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Let us make sure there are no misunderstandings or conflicts until that agreement ends.
  From ITALY: Given my current situation, a strategic withdrawal is not an option for me yet. I aim to retake Naples and Rome. For my dislodged unit F ION, it seems the only legal retreat option is to the Adriatic Sea (ADR). However, any aggressive moves from France will be met with a determined response.
  From RUSSIA: Your plan against Italy seems to be on track. Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Germany makes sense. However, we need to make sure that our non-aggression pact with Germany expires at the end of 1914. What are your specific plans for a joint action against Germany?
  From TURKEY: France, as another dominant power, could you provide any diplomatic support or intervention against Russia or Austria to help prolong my survival?

REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json

  From AUSTRIA: It seems that Italy is our common enemy now. Once Turkey is neutralized, let's make a well-coordinated action against Italy. Your units in Naples (F NAP) and the Ionian Sea (F ION) could make a move on Italy's remaining units and supply centers such as TUN or VEN.
  From GERMANY: Hello, France. Our non-aggression pact is in place until the end of 1914. I hope we can continue to honor this agreement.
  From ITALY: Dear France, we previously discussed a temporary truce until the end of 1914. However, the situation has evolved where your unit in NAP poses a significant threat to us. While we aim to maintain the truce until the end of 1914, it is important that we make a strategic plan for a peaceful resolution or a clear understanding of our future intentions, especially regarding Naples and Rome.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany and plan for a coordinated action against Germany once Turkey is neutralized.
  From TURKEY: I request any diplomatic support or suggestions for alliances against Russia or Austria.

Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I agree that Italy should be neutralized first. Let us make a plan for a joint action against Italy. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a plan for a future action against another power such as Germany or Russia. What are your thoughts on that?
  From ENGLAND: I agree that we should make a final push to eliminate Italy from the game. Once Italy is neutralized, it makes sense to turn our attention to Germany. However, we need to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. Once Italy is out, a coordinated plan against Germany seems like a good next step. What specific moves do you have in mind for this round against Italy?
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. Once Italy is neutralized, our main focus should be on addressing potential threats from England or Russia. The future relations could be based on a mutual understanding to keep a balance of power in Europe. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ITALY: I reject your peace proposal which requires me to disband units and cede supply centers. However, I propose a temporary truce until the end of 1914 where both of us make no aggressive moves against each other. However, I still aim to retake Naples once the situation with Turkey is resolved.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that our long-term alliance has been successful. Let's make a final push against Italy until it is fully neutralized. Once Italy is out of the game, we should make a coordinated plan against Germany.
  From TURKEY: Dear France, my situation is dire with only one unit and one supply center left. Any diplomatic support or suggestions for alliances against Russia or Italy would be greatly appreciated.

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Winter 1914 Adjustment phase (W1914A), no supply centers changed hands. Consequently, any unit adjustments made by the powers would be based on the supply center distribution from the end of the Fall 1914 Movement phase where Austria successfully captured Trieste from Italy, thus increasing Austria's supply center count while decreasing Italy's. The specific unit builds or disbands for this phase are not specified here, but the ownership of supply centers remains unchanged."}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Winter 1914 Adjustment phase (W1914A), no supply centers changed hands. Consequently, any unit adjustments made by the powers would be based on the supply center distribution from the end of the Fall 1914 Movement phase where Austria successfully captured Trieste from Italy, thus increasing Austria's supply center count while decreasing Italy's. The specific unit builds or disbands for this phase are not specified here, but the ownership of supply centers remains unchanged."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear France, once Turkey is neutralized, I propose a joint action against Italy. I suggest that you make a move on Italy's southern territories such as Naples while I make a move on Venice. What do you think?
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, it seems we both have 7 supply centers now. Given the current balance of power, we need to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. What are your intentions for this round? I am open to a temporary truce if you are willing to make a plan to check another major power such as Germany or Austria.
  From GERMANY: Hello France, I propose that we extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. I hope that we can maintain peace on our borders while we both focus on other fronts.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I propose a temporary truce until the end of 1915 where you withdraw from PIE and NAP and allow me to retake Rome. This would help us both focus on other threats such as Germany or England. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: Once Turkey is neutralized, we should reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany. Let us make a plan once Turkey is out of the picture.
  From TURKEY: I am in a precarious position with only one unit in Smyrna and one supply center. If there is any way you could provide diplomatic support or suggest an alliance that might help me survive, I would greatly appreciate it.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello France, yes, a joint plan against Italy once Turkey is neutralized makes sense. I suggest that we make a well-coordinated plan such that Austria can make a significant gain such as capturing Venice. We need to make sure that Italy is neutralized effectively so that our power in the region is strengthened.
  From GERMANY: Hello France, I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. I have no aggressive plans against France for now.
  From ITALY: Hello France, while I understand your need to keep Naples and Rome, I aim to retake these territories in the long term. For now, a truce until the end of 1915 could be acceptable if you make no aggressive moves against my units and if you are open to negotiating a plan against another power like Austria or Germany once Turkey is neutralized.
  From RUSSIA: Hello France, I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Germany should be planned. However, we need to make sure that our long-term alliance against Germany is maintained and that we make a well-coordinated plan against Germany once Turkey is out of the game.

Phase: S1915R, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Spring 1915 Movement phase (S1915M), no supply centers changed hands. The territorial control thus remained the same as it was after the Fall 1914 Movement phase, where Austria had captured Trieste from Italy. The phase passed without any significant changes in the ownership of supply centers."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1915R
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A PAR, A PIE, F NAP, A MAR, F SPA/NC, F TUN, *F BRE
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "GRE"], ["A", "VIE"], ["A", "TRI"], ["A", "ALB"], ["A", "BUD"]], "ENGLAND": [["A", "LON"], ["F", "BAL"], ["F", "DEN"], ["F", "PIC"], ["F", "IRI"], ["F", "BRE"], ["F", "BEL"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["A", "PIE"], ["F", "NAP"], ["A", "MAR"], ["F", "SPA/NC"], ["F", "TUN"], ["*F", "BRE"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "BUR"], ["F", "SWE"], ["A", "TYR"], ["A", "RUH"], ["A", "BOH"]], "ITALY": [["A", "VEN"], ["F", "EAS"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "GAL"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "BLA"], ["F", "STP/NC"], ["A", "ANK"]], "TURKEY": [["A", "SMY"]]}
  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "BUL", "GRE", "SER", "TRI", "VIE"], "ENGLAND": ["BEL", "DEN", "EDI", "HOL", "LON", "LVP", "NWY"], "FRANCE": ["BRE", "MAR", "NAP", "PAR", "POR", "ROM", "SPA"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "KIE", "MUN", "SWE", "WAR"], "ITALY": ["TUN", "VEN"], "RUSSIA": ["ANK", "CON", "MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "STP"], "TURKEY": ["SMY"]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear France, once Turkey is neutralized, a well-coordinated action against Italy should be our next step. How do you plan to make a move on Italy? Perhaps a naval attack on VEN or a land attack on PIE could be part of the plan.
  From ENGLAND: France, while we need to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant, it seems that the balance of power is currently in question. What are your intentions for this round?
  From GERMANY: Hello, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. However, I need to make you aware that I am also in communication with other powers. Let us keep the peace on our borders.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I want to reaffirm our temporary truce until the end of 1915 where you should withdraw from PIE and NAP and allow Italy to retake Rome. I hope you understand that any aggressive moves against Italy should be avoided to keep the truce valid.
  From RUSSIA: We need to make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once that is done, we should make a joint action against Germany as previously agreed. How do you plan to make moves against Germany once Turkey is out of the game?
  From TURKEY: Given our dire situation, any diplomatic support against Russia or Austria would be greatly appreciated. We need any last-ditch support you can provide.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear France, I reaffirm our joint plan against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. However, it seems that other powers such as England are suggesting a joint action against you once Turkey is neutralized. Thus, it might be important to make a well-coordinated plan that makes sure that once Italy is neutralized, the next steps are clear and agreed upon. Let us make sure that our actions are well-coordinated.
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I want to reaffirm our joint plan against Italy until Turkey is neutralized. Once Turkey is neutralized, I agree that our plan should shift towards Germany. However, regarding the issue of my fleet in Brest, I need to make a plan to ensure that our joint efforts against Italy and Germany are successful. Once a more stable situation is reached, we can make a plan for Brest. Let us continue our cooperation until we have neutralized Italy and then turn our attention to Germany.
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915 and express a desire to continue respecting this agreement until that time. However, any aggressive moves by France against Germany or its allies could jeopardize the pact. I hope we can continue to work together peacefully until the end of 1915.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I acknowledge our temporary truce until the end of 1915. However, I must reject your suggestion of a surrender or a more permanent peace agreement where I disband my remaining units. Instead, I aim to retake Rome and Naples in the future. I am open to a temporary truce until the end of 1915 where you should withdraw from PIE and NAP and allow me to retake Rome.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, I want to reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany. However, until Turkey is neutralized, our plan should be to make a well-coordinated action against Italy. Once Turkey is out, we should make a plan to make a joint action against Germany.
  From TURKEY: Dear France, thank you for your sympathy and offer of a 'token gesture of support.' What specific support could you offer to help me hold Smyrna or make a strategic retreat if necessary?

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: RETREAT / OTHER
CRITICAL: Submit orders appropriate for this phase type (e.g., Retreat or Disband for units needing retreats). Consult rules.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Let's make a plan for a joint action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. What do you think about making a move on VEN from PIE once Turkey is out of the game?
  From ENGLAND: France, now that you have 7 centers, we need to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. However, Germany and Russia are still significant threats. Would you be interested in a temporary truce so that we can both make a plan against Germany who has been a common threat to us?
  From GERMANY: Hello France, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. How do you see the current situation?
  From ITALY: Dear France, I reiterate our temporary truce until the end of 1915 where you should withdraw from PIE and NAP and allow me to retake Rome. However, I see that you still have a fleet in NAP. Can you confirm that you will honor the truce and make no aggressive moves against Italy?
  From RUSSIA: We need to make a final push against Turkey. Once Turkey is neutralized, our long-term alliance against Germany should be reaffirmed. How do you plan to make a move against Germany?
  From TURKEY: Dear France, as a last resort, I am seeking your diplomatic support against any potential moves by Russia, Austria, or Italy towards my only remaining unit in Smyrna. Any support or intervention you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear France, I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, a joint plan against Italy makes sense. Your proposal to make a coordinated effort against Italy is well-received. Let us make a plan for a joint attack on Italy once Turkey is completely out of the game.
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I agree that we should continue our joint plan against Italy until Turkey is completely out of the game. Once that is done, turning our attention to Germany makes sense. I assure you that my unit in Belgium will not make any aggressive moves against France for now. We need to maintain a united front against our common enemies.
  From GERMANY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful and that we do not make any aggressive moves against each other.
  From ITALY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. However, once Turkey is neutralized, I need to make a move to retake Rome and Naples. I hope we can find a peaceful resolution for this once Turkey is out of the game.
  From RUSSIA: Yes, Turkey is close to being neutralized. Once that is done, as per our long-term alliance, our attention should turn to Germany. However, we need to make a well-coordinated effort. Your units should make sure that Italy does not make any unexpected moves while we focus on Turkey.

CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

\boxed{"The Fall 1915 Movement phase (F1915M) also did not result in any changes in the ownership of supply centers.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Turkey appears to be out of the game now. It seems like the next logical step is to make a well-coordinated action against Italy once the non-aggression pact with Italy expires at the end of 1915. How can we best work together on this?
  From ENGLAND: France, while you currently have seven supply centers like us, it seems that a balanced game is in everyone's interest. However, Germany may be looking to make a move on us. What are your intentions for the next round, and how can we make a plan to keep a balance of power in Europe?
  From GERMANY: Hello, France. I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From ITALY: We need to make a temporary truce until the end of 1915 where you should withdraw from PIE and NAP and allow us to retake Rome and Naples. Italy needs to regain some of its lost centers to stay in the game.
  From RUSSIA: Our long-term alliance against Germany should still be valid once Turkey is neutralized. However, the Northern Triple alliance might make a move against you. Be prepared and let us keep our lines of communication open.
  From TURKEY: My only unit (A SMY) has been dislodged by Russia. Any last-ditch diplomatic support you can provide against Russia or Austria would be greatly appreciated.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, it makes sense for us to continue our joint plan against Italy. Let us make sure that our efforts are well-coordinated and that we make a well-coordinated action against Italy once Turkey is neutralized.
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I agree that once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a plan to turn our focus towards Germany. However, let us make sure that Italy is sufficiently weakened first. We should continue our joint plan against Italy until that is achieved. Once Italy is out of the game, we can make a well-coordinated plan against Germany.
  From GERMANY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Let us work together to ensure stability in our borders until that time.
  From ITALY: I acknowledge that our truce should remain until the end of 1915. However, it is important that you understand that Italy still aims to retake Rome and Naples once our truce is over. We need to make a plan for the future once the truce ends.
  From RUSSIA: Once Turkey is neutralized, a joint action against Germany makes sense. However, a plan against Italy should be our first priority as it seems many powers are also targeting Italy. Once Italy is dealt with, a plan against Germany makes sense.
  From TURKEY: Given that Russia has taken Smyrna and seems to be a significant threat, I am open to an alliance against Russia. Any support from you could be helpful. What specific actions can you take to help us against Russia?

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Winter 1915 Adjustment phase (W1915A), there were no changes in the ownership of supply centers. England retained control of Brest (BRE) which it had captured from France in the previous phase, while Russia continued to hold Smyrna (SMY) which it had taken from Turkey. The lack of new center captures indicates a period of consolidation where the powers focused on reinforcing their current positions rather than expanding their territories."}

Phase: S1916M, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Winter 1915 Adjustment phase (W1915A), there were no changes in the ownership of supply centers. England retained control of Brest (BRE) which it had captured from France in the previous phase, while Russia continued to hold Smyrna (SMY) which it had taken from Turkey. The lack of new center captures indicates a period of consolidation where the powers focused on reinforcing their current positions rather than expanding their territories."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: France, now that Turkey is neutralized, let us make a plan for a well-coordinated action against Italy. Your units in A PIE and A MAR could be very helpful here. What are your thoughts?
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, our current situation requires us to make strategic decisions that might not always align. However, I hope we can maintain a diplomatic and strategic balance. What are your intentions for this round?
  From GERMANY: Hello France, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. However, I need to make sure that any actions are well-coordinated with my other strategic commitments.
  From ITALY: Dear France, while I aim to retake Rome and Naples, I propose a temporary truce until the end of 1916. However, I need a plan to make a peaceful retake of these centers. What are your thoughts on this?
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, now that Turkey is neutralized, it's time to make a well-coordinated action against Italy. Once Italy is out of the game, we should make a plan against Germany. Let us reaffirm our 'long-term alliance against Germany' and make a plan to act against Germany once Italy is neutralized.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear France, now that Turkey is neutralized, I agree that a joint action against Italy makes sense. Italy only has two supply centers and two units, making it a strategic target. I suggest that we make a well-coordinated plan to eliminate Italy first. Once Italy is out of the game, we can make a plan against another major power such as Germany or Russia. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I understand your concerns regarding Brest. However, given that Turkey is now out of the game, our next part of the plan should indeed be focusing on Germany. However, I need to make a plan with our allies such as Russia and possibly Austria to make a well-coordinated action against Germany. For now, I suggest that we make a temporary truce regarding Brest until Germany is dealt with. What are your specific plans for a coordinated action against Germany?
  From GERMANY: I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. It is important that we make sure our borders are secure. However, I need to make sure that this does not conflict with any other strategic commitments I have made.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I understand that my position is weak. However, I am not ready to disband my units yet. I am open to a new truce where I keep Venice and Tunis until the end of the game if I agree to support France against another power such as Germany. However, I need Rome and Naples back. What are your thoughts on a deal where we make a joint action against Germany while I aim to retake Rome and Naples?
  From RUSSIA: I acknowledge our long-term alliance against Germany. However, it makes sense for us to first make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is neutralized. After that, a joint plan against Germany could be made. Let us make a plan against Italy first.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear France, now that Turkey is neutralized, it is time to make a well-coordinated action against Italy. Could you make a move on Naples or Tunis from the sea? A joint action against Italy should make us all stronger.
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, it appears that Russia has 7 centers and is a growing power. If you are open, let us make a plan to contain Russia's expansion. However, let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful for now. What are your plans for this round?
  From GERMANY: Hello, France. Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. What are your plans for this round?
  From ITALY: Dear France, I am willing to maintain a temporary truce until the end of 1916. However, it is important for me to make it clear that my main goal is to retake Rome and Naples. Once the truce ends, I aim to make a move on these territories unless a new agreement is reached.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, Turkey has been eliminated. Our long-term alliance against Germany should still hold. However, our next target should be Italy. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a well-coordinated action against Germany. Let us plan a joint action against Italy first.

Phase: F1916M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello France, I agree that now that Turkey is out of the game, it is time to act on our previous agreement to coordinate against Italy. I propose that you make a move on NAP or TUN while I make a move on VEN or TUN. Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy.
  From ENGLAND: France, I am open to a temporary truce until the end of 1916 where we both agree not to make any aggressive moves against each other. However, a truce should include a mutual non-aggression pact where France does not make any moves against Brest or any other of my holdings. If you agree, we can focus on other threats such as Germany.
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I am glad to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916. Once that period ends, we should indeed discuss our future plans and any potential for continued cooperation.
  From ITALY: Hello France, I do not intend to surrender or disband my units. Instead, I aim to retake my lost territories such as Rome and Naples. A coordinated action against me with Austria and Russia would only make the situation more chaotic. I suggest that you make a strategic withdrawal from Rome and Naples to avoid further conflict.
  From RUSSIA: Hello France, I agree that it is important to reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany once Italy is neutralized. Given that Turkey is no longer a threat, I believe we should coordinate a plan to eliminate Italy first and then turn our attention to Germany. What is your current plan for making a move on Italy?

The truce with England until the end of 1916 means I should avoid any aggressive moves against England such as moving F MAO to BRE. The main focus should be on a coordinated action against Italy with Austria and Russia. Thus, A PAR should hold to defend against any potential moves from England or Germany. A PIE should move to Venice (A PIE - VEN) to support Austria's plan against Italy. A MAR should hold in Marseilles to defend against any potential moves from Italy or to support any moves from PIE or PAR if needed. F SPA/NC should hold in Spain's North Coast to protect the Iberian Peninsula. F MAO should hold in Mid-Atlantic Ocean to protect against any potential moves from England and to support any moves in the Iberian Peninsula. F TYS should move to Naples (F TYS - NAP) to make a move on Italy's remaining supply centers. Final Plan: A PAR H, A PIE - VEN, A MAR H, F SPA/NC H, F MAO H, F TYS - NAP."

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase (W1916A), no supply centers changed ownership. The territorial changes from the Fall 1916 Movement phase (F1916M) were thus finalized, with Germany now holding Holland (gained from England) while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw).}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: France, let us make a joint action against Italy where you make a move on NAP or TUN while I make a move on VEN. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a plan against Russia, who is now the most powerful player with 8 supply centers.
  From ENGLAND: France, Russia has now become the leading power with 8 supply centers and might be a common threat. Given that Germany has been a rival for us both, what do you think about making a joint plan against Russia or continuing our efforts against Germany?
  From GERMANY: Hello, France. I propose to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. What are your thoughts?
  From ITALY: Dear France, I propose a temporary truce until the end of 1917 where we agree not to make any aggressive moves against each other. However, it is important for me to make it clear that I aim to retake Rome and Naples once the truce ends. If you agree to this truce, it could give us time to make a plan to address any other threats such as Germany or Russia.
  From RUSSIA: We need to make a plan against Germany once Italy is neutralized. However, for now, our main focus should be on making a final push against Italy.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I agree that a coordinated action against Italy makes sense. I plan to make a move on Venice (VEN) while you could make a move on Tuscany (TUS) or Tunis (TUN). Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a plan against another major power such as Russia or Germany.
  From ENGLAND: France, thank you for your message. We understand your need for Brest and are open to negotiating its return. However, for now, it is strategically important for us to hold Brest until we make a plan against a common threat like Germany or Russia. We are willing to maintain a truce until the end of 1916 and make a plan for a future alliance against Germany once your non-aggression pact ends. However, we need to make a solid plan against Russia's growing power as well.
  From GERMANY: I am happy to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1916, but since we are now in 1917, I propose extending this non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Let us keep our borders peaceful.
  From ITALY: France, I reject your demand for a 'peaceful surrender' where I disband my units and exit the game. Instead, I propose a new non-aggression pact until the end of 1917 where I keep my current centers (TUN and VEN) and units (A TUS and F TYS) intact. Given that Russia is the leading power with 8 centers, it might make sense for us to make a joint plan against a common threat such as Russia. What are your thoughts?
  From RUSSIA: I agree that once Italy is fully neutralized, a long-term alliance against Germany should be reaffirmed. A coordinated action against Germany could be a strategic next step once Italy is dealt with. Let's make a plan for that once Italy is out.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Spring 1917 Movement phase (S1917M) did not result in any changes in supply center ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was after the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase (W1916A), where Germany gained Holland from England while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw).}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Spring 1917 Movement phase (S1917M) did not result in any changes in supply center ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was after the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase (W1916A), where Germany gained Holland from England while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw).}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1917R
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A PAR, A MAR, F SPA/NC, F MAO, F NAP, A TUS

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a plan against the next major threat. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ENGLAND: France, Russia currently has the most supply centers with 8. It might be in our mutual interest to make a plan against Russia to prevent them from becoming too dominant. However, we should also make sure that neither of us expands too much. What are your thoughts on a joint plan against Russia?
  From GERMANY: Hello France, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. What are your plans for the next round? Do you need any support from us?
  From ITALY: France, a temporary truce until the end of 1917 where you make no aggressive moves towards Rome could be beneficial for us both. However, Italy still aims to retake Rome and Naples in the future.
  From RUSSIA: We acknowledge our long-term alliance against Germany once Italy is neutralized. However, a well-coordinated action against Italy should be made first.

  From AUSTRIA: I agree that a final push against Italy is necessary. Once Italy is neutralized, I suggest that we divide the remaining Italian territories based on mutual agreement and strategic needs. For instance, I could take Venice (VEN) while you could take Rome (ROM) and Naples (NAP).
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, while Brest is a crucial supply center for me, I am open to negotiating a plan where we make a temporary truce until the end of 1917 and focus on a joint plan against Germany once Italy is completely neutralized. However, any plan should also keep an eye on the balance of power so that no single power becomes too dominant. What specific moves do you propose for this round?
  From GERMANY: We agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. We will keep the peace until the end of the year and reassess our relationship once the pact expires.
  From ITALY: Dear France, your offer for a peaceful surrender is not acceptable. We intend to defend our remaining centers and units until the end. Any coordinated action against us will be met with resistance. We aim to continue playing until the game ends.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany once Italy is neutralized. Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy first and then make a plan for a joint action against Germany.

Phase Type: RETREAT / OTHER
CRITICAL: Submit orders appropriate for this phase type (e.g., Retreat or Disband for units needing retreats). Consult rules.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1917 Retreat phase (S1917R), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was after the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase where Germany gained Holland from England while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw). The retreat phase did not result in any new unit movements or dislodgments, thus maintaining the status quo established in the previous movement phase.}

Phase: F1917M, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1917 Retreat phase (S1917R), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was after the Winter 1916 Adjustment phase where Germany gained Holland from England while losing Warsaw to Russia. Consequently, Germany's total number of supply centers remained the same, while England lost one center (Holland) and Russia gained one center (Warsaw). The retreat phase did not result in any new unit movements or dislodgments, thus maintaining the status quo established in the previous movement phase.}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1917M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A PAR, A MAR, F SPA/NC, F MAO, F NAP, A TUS
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "VIE"], ["A", "ALB"], ["A", "BUD"], ["A", "SER"], ["A", "VEN"]], "ENGLAND": [["A", "LON"], ["F", "BAL"], ["F", "PIC"], ["F", "BRE"], ["F", "BEL"], ["F", "EDI"], ["F", "SWE"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "PAR"], ["A", "MAR"], ["F", "SPA/NC"], ["F", "MAO"], ["F", "NAP"], ["A", "TUS"]], "GERMANY": [["A", "BUR"], ["A", "HOL"], ["A", "RUH"], ["A", "PIE"]], "ITALY": [["F", "TYS"], ["A", "ROM"]], "RUSSIA": [["F", "BLA"], ["F", "STP/NC"], ["A", "ANK"], ["A", "WAR"], ["A", "ARM"], ["F", "RUM"], ["A", "MOS"], ["A", "BOH"]], "TURKEY": []}
  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "BUL", "GRE", "SER", "TRI", "VIE"], "ENGLAND": ["BEL", "BRE", "DEN", "EDI", "LON", "LVP", "NWY"], "FRANCE": ["MAR", "NAP", "PAR", "POR", "ROM", "SPA"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "HOL", "KIE", "MUN", "SWE"], "ITALY": ["TUN", "VEN"], "RUSSIA": ["ANK", "CON", "MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "SMY", "STP", "WAR"], "TURKEY": []}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear France, let us make a joint action against Italy where you make a move on NAP or TUN from the sea (F NAP could make a move on TYS or support an attack on ROM). Once Italy is neutralized, we need to make a plan against another major power such as Russia.
  From ENGLAND: France, Russia is now the leading power with 8 supply centers. It might be in our mutual interest to make a plan against Russia to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb Russia's expansion?
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I need to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. What are your current plans? It would be helpful to know if there are any actions you plan that might require my units not to interfere.
  From ITALY: We propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Given our current weak position, it makes sense for us to not make any aggressive moves against each other.
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is neutralized. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a plan to act against Germany. Our long-term alliance against Germany should be reaffirmed.

  From AUSTRIA: I agree that a final push against Italy should be made until it is neutralized. Once Italy is out, we should make a plan against Russia as the next major threat. Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy.
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I am willing to vacate Brest if that makes a truce until the end of 1917. I also agree with your proposal for a possible future alliance against Germany once Italy is neutralized. Let us make a plan for this round to make sure that Italy is neutralized first.
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1917. Once Italy is neutralized, we should indeed discuss what happens next. However, any plan against England should be carefully considered given that England has been a part of the 'Northern Triple' alliance. Let us make a plan once Italy is out of the picture.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I reject the 'surrender' offer. However, I am open to a temporary truce where we both focus on a common enemy such as Russia. Russia is now the leading power with 8 supply centers and poses a threat to both of us. Let us make a plan against Russia together.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, I reaffirm our long-term alliance against Germany once Italy is neutralized. Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy where you make a move on Rome while I make a move on Venice or Tuscany. Once Italy is neutralized, a joint action against Germany should be planned.

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Winter 1917 Adjustment phase (W1917A), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers remained as it was at the end of the Fall 1917 Movement phase. Thus, England still holds the additional center of Sweden, which it captured from Germany. Italy retains control of Rome, which it took from France, while Austria still holds Venice, which it captured from Italy. The net result is that England has gained one center (Sweden), Austria has gained one center (Venice), Italy has a net change of zero centers (gaining Rome but losing Venice), France has lost one center (Rome), and Germany has lost one center (Sweden).}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Winter 1917 Adjustment phase (W1917A), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers remained as it was at the end of the Fall 1917 Movement phase. Thus, England still holds the additional center of Sweden, which it captured from Germany. Italy retains control of Rome, which it took from France, while Austria still holds Venice, which it captured from Italy. The net result is that England has gained one center (Sweden), Austria has gained one center (Venice), Italy has a net change of zero centers (gaining Rome but losing Venice), France has lost one center (Rome), and Germany has lost one center (Sweden).}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: France, it seems that Italy is on the brink of being eliminated. Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy this round to make sure it is neutralized. Once Italy is out, I suggest we make a well-coordinated action against Russia, which has become a major power with 8 supply centers. What do you think?
  From GERMANY: Hello France, I propose that we extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Do you agree? Also, what are your plans for this round?
  From ITALY: Given our past negotiations and the current game state, I propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Italy aims to focus on retaking lost territories such as Venice from Austria. Can we agree to a mutual non-aggression pact until the end of 1918?
  From RUSSIA: Once Italy is neutralized, our plan is to make a well-coordinated action against Germany. It makes sense for us to maintain a long-term alliance against Germany. What is your plan once Italy is out of the game?

  From AUSTRIA: Dear France, I agree that a final push against Italy until it is neutralized makes sense. Once Italy is out of the picture, we should make a well-coordinated plan against another major power such as Russia. A stable border between us would be important once Italy is neutralized.
  From ENGLAND: France, I understand your concerns about Brest and Picardy. However, our main priority should be to make sure that Italy is neutralized first. Once Italy is out, a joint action against Germany makes sense. However, vacating Brest and Picardy might not be in our best interest unless there is a solid plan for a joint action against Germany. What specific moves do you propose for this round against Italy?
  From GERMANY: I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. A stable border makes sense until other threats are addressed. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a plan to address the major powers such as England and Russia.
  From ITALY: France, I acknowledge that my situation is dire. However, a coordinated attack against me might not be the best use of your resources. I propose a temporary truce where I focus on defending my remaining centers. This could allow you to focus on other threats such as England or Germany.
  From RUSSIA: France, I am still on board with our long-term alliance against Germany once Italy is neutralized. However, to make a well-coordinated action against Germany, we need to make sure that Italy is completely out of the picture first. Let us make a plan to make a joint action against Germany once Italy is neutralized.

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1918 Movement phase (S1918M), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was at the end of the Winter 1917 Adjustment phase. England still holds Sweden (which it captured from Germany), Italy still holds Rome (which it captured from France), and Austria still holds Venice (which it captured from Italy). The net result is that England has one additional center (Sweden), Austria has one additional center (Venice), Italy has a net change of zero centers (gaining Rome but losing Venice), France has lost one center (Rome), and Germany has lost one center (Sweden).}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1918 Movement phase (S1918M), no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remains the same as it was at the end of the Winter 1917 Adjustment phase. England still holds Sweden (which it captured from Germany), Italy still holds Rome (which it captured from France), and Austria still holds Venice (which it captured from Italy). The net result is that England has one additional center (Sweden), Austria has one additional center (Venice), Italy has a net change of zero centers (gaining Rome but losing Venice), France has lost one center (Rome), and Germany has lost one center (Sweden).}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Great job dislodging Italy's unit in Rome. It seems that Italy is on the verge of being eliminated if it loses one more supply center. Let's make sure that Italy is completely neutralized. Once Italy is out, we should make a plan against another major power such as Russia. What do you think?
  From ENGLAND: France, Russia has now emerged as a significant power with 8 supply centers and 8 units. It might be in our mutual interest to make a plan to make sure that Russia does not become too dominant. What are your thoughts on a temporary alliance against Russia?
  From GERMANY: Hello, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Let us continue our peaceful relations.
  From ITALY: We propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Given your unit in Rome and our unit in TYS, it makes sense for us to avoid conflict. What are your intentions regarding Rome and Naples?
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, our long-term alliance against Germany should still hold until Italy is neutralized. However, once Italy is out of the game, we need to make a strategic plan to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. What are your thoughts on a joint action against a major power such as England once Italy is neutralized?

  From GERMANY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. It has been beneficial for both of us thus far.
  From ITALY: France, I accept your demand and will allow your unit 'A ROM' to retreat to APU. However, I need a firm commitment on this truce until the end of 1918. Any further aggressive actions against me should be avoided until we reach the end of this year.
  From RUSSIA: I understand your need for help in retaking Rome and neutralizing Italy. Once Italy is neutralized, as per our long-term alliance, we should turn our attention to Germany. For now, let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is completely neutralized.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: You did a great job dislodging Italy's unit in Rome. Once Italy is neutralized, we should make a plan against Russia who currently has the most supply centers along with England.
  From ENGLAND: France, Italy is now significantly weakened. The main threat now appears to be Russia, which has 8 centers and 8 units. I propose a joint action against Russia once Italy is completely neutralized. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From GERMANY: Hello, France. I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Do you agree?
  From ITALY: France, Italy proposes a truce where we focus on a common enemy such as Russia or Austria. If you agree to withdraw from Rome and Naples, we could work together against a mutual threat. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a well-coordinated action against Italy until it is completely neutralized. Once Italy is out, we should make a plan against Germany as part of our long-term alliance against Germany.

  From AUSTRIA: I agree to make a coordinated action against Italy. I plan to move A VEN to TUS and A ALB can support an attack on APU if necessary. Let us make sure that Italy is completely neutralized this round.
  From ENGLAND: I understand your request to vacate Brest. I propose a truce until the end of 1918 and would be open to discussing a potential future alliance against Germany once Italy is neutralized. However, once Italy is out, we need to make a plan against Russia as well.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1918. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From ITALY: If I make a strategic withdrawal and disband my remaining units, will you guarantee a truce until the end of the game and make no further aggressive moves against any remaining Italian units or supply centers?
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push to neutralize Italy completely. Once Italy is out, a joint action against Germany makes sense. Our unit in TYR could be used to support an attack on VEN or TUS once Italy is out.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Fall 1918 Movement phase (F1918M), England successfully captured Kiel from Germany, thus gaining control of that supply center while Germany lost it. Simultaneously, France made a significant move by capturing Rome from Italy, which resulted in France gaining control of Rome while Italy lost it. These changes reflect a strategic shift in the control of key supply centers among the involved powers.}
