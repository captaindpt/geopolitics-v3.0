  From ENGLAND: Hello France, I appreciate your proposal for a peaceful arrangement where you focus on the English Channel while I focus on the North Sea. I am open to a non-aggression pact for this turn where neither of us moves into the English Channel. However, for a long-term plan, I believe we need to further discuss how we can mutually benefit from our geographical positions. What are your thoughts on a more structured long-term alliance?
  From GERMANY: Hello France, I agree to a non-aggression pact so that we can focus on other regions. I might focus on the east while you focus on the west. Let us avoid early conflicts and support each other in our respective regions.
  From ITALY: Hello France, I agree to a non-aggression pact where I focus on the Eastern Mediterranean and possibly against Austria while you focus on the north and west. To ensure mutual non-aggression, I suggest that I avoid moving towards the Western Mediterranean and that you avoid moving towards the Italian mainland. How does that sound?

To Italy, confirm the non-aggression pact and ask for their specific plans in the Mediterranean. To Russia, express interest in an alliance against a common threat and ask for a more detailed plan."

  From ENGLAND: I agree to your proposal for a peaceful division of the English Channel where you stay out of the English Channel (ENG) if I stay out of the Mid-Atlantic Ocean (MAO). However, I would like to discuss a more long-term structured alliance where we can support each other against other powers such as Germany or Russia. What are your thoughts on a potential alliance?
  From GERMANY: Greetings France, I agree with your proposal for a non-aggression pact where both of us agree not to attack each other for the first few turns. This will allow us to focus on other potential threats and expand our influence elsewhere. Let us respect each other's borders and work on our respective goals.
  From ITALY: Greetings, France. I agree to a non-aggression pact where you focus on the north while I focus on expanding towards the Balkans or Turkey. Let us make sure that our borders remain peaceful.

  From ENGLAND: Hello France, I agree that we need to reaffirm our agreement on the peaceful split of the English Channel. It makes sense for us to focus on the North Sea and Scandinavia while you keep a fleet in the English Channel. However, let us make sure that any fleet in the English Channel is used for mutual defense against Germany rather than as a potential threat to us. Germany should indeed remain our priority target.
  From ITALY: Hello, our non-aggression pact is important to me as well. I agree that focusing on Austria makes sense given your plans for Germany and England. Could you share more details on how you plan to handle Germany and England? Additionally, what are your plans for the Mediterranean region? I need to make sure our mutual interests are aligned.
  From RUSSIA: I am interested in a long-term alliance where you focus on Germany while I focus on Austria and Turkey. For now, I suggest that you make moves against Germany while I make moves against Austria and Turkey. This way, we can both make gains in our respective areas of interest. Let us keep in touch and coordinate our actions.

    "arguments": {
      "thought": "Based on the current game state and the previous round of negotiations, it seems that France has been focusing on consolidating its position in Western Europe while trying to maintain a non-aggression pact with England, Germany, and Italy. However, the main goal should be to expand and secure more supply centers. Given that France has units in MAO, BRE, BUR, HOL, and POR, it makes sense to continue focusing on expanding into the English Channel and possibly the Mediterranean. However, a key part of the strategy should be to make sure that Germany is kept in check while trying to make gains against England or Italy if possible. Another important part of the strategy should be to make sure that Russia does not make any aggressive moves against us. 

1. **England**: Since France has a unit in the English Channel (MAO), it makes sense to try to negotiate a peaceful division of the English Channel with England. However, if England does not agree, France should be prepared to make a move against England's units in the North Sea (NTH) and London (LON).

2. **Germany**: The non-aggression pact should be reaffirmed, but France should be cautious and make sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards Belgium or Burgundy. A unit in BUR can be used to keep an eye on Germany's unit in Ruh (RUH).

3. **Italy**: The non-aggression pact should be reaffirmed, and France should make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards Marseilles (MAR) or Spain. However, France should also make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards Austria or Turkey, which could make Italy too strong.

4. **Russia**: Although there was a previous round of negotiation where a non-aggression pact was reaffirmed and a coordinated action against Germany was proposed, it seems that Russia might be more focused on the Eastern part of the map. However, it is important to make sure that Russia does not make any aggressive moves towards Germany if France plans to make a move against Germany.

5. **Austria and Turkey**: Although there was no direct communication mentioned previously, it might be worth reaching out to Austria and Turkey to make sure that they are not making any aggressive moves against France's allies or making any deals that could be detrimental to France's interests.

Based on this reasoning, the plan for this round should be:
- Send a message to England to reaffirm the previous proposal for a joint plan against Germany and to make sure that there is a peaceful division of the English Channel.
- Send a message to Germany to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and make sure that there is a mutual standoff in Belgium.
- Send a message to Italy to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and suggest cooperation in the Mediterranean.
- Send a message to Russia to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and make sure that any coordinated action against Germany is still on the table.
- Update the memory to keep track of the messages sent and the responses received."

Could you provide a more detailed plan on how you plan to make your moves against Germany and what specific support you need from us? For instance, what moves do you plan for your A BUR and A HOL units? We need a well-coordinated plan.
  From GERMANY: Our non-aggression pact still stands. However, the unit in BUR makes me a bit uneasy as it could be seen as a threat to RUH. Can we make a mutual standoff where your A BUR does not make aggressive moves towards RUH while my A RUH stays put or makes a non-threatening move such as A RUH -> BUR (supporting hold)?
  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact is still in place and I am glad to continue our cooperation in the Mediterranean. Any support from your unit in MAO for actions in the Western Mediterranean would be appreciated. Let us make sure our units do not come into conflict.

\boxed{"In the Fall 1902 Movement phase, despite the active deployment of new units built previously by France, England, Turkey, Italy, Austria, and Russia, no supply centers changed hands. This suggests that the powers may have been engaged in strategic maneuvers or defensive actions that did not result in the capture of any new territories. The phase thus appears to be a continuation of the previous one where the focus was on consolidating positions and making strategic moves without immediate territorial gains."}

  From ITALY: Dear France, it seems that no supply centers changed hands in the Fall 1902 Movement phase. Given our non-aggression pact, I want to reaffirm our peaceful intentions and seek your thoughts on any future plans. Previously, we proposed a joint action against Austria which might help us both gain strategic advantages. What are your thoughts on coordinating moves in the next round?

  From AUSTRIA: Hello France, thank you for your message. My main focus is currently on the Balkans and Eastern Europe. However, I am open to finding ways to cooperate where our interests align. Let us keep a line of communication open for future opportunities.
  From ENGLAND: Hello France, thank you for your message. I agree that our alliance should remain strong. The unit in KIE is a significant strategic move against Germany. Let's plan a coordinated attack on Germany. What specific support do you need from me? However, once Germany is defeated, I propose that we make sure that Russia does not become a threat. What are your thoughts on that?
  From GERMANY: Hello France. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, the presence of your unit in KIE is a significant concern. A true non-aggression pact should perhaps involve a French retreat from KIE. I hope that we can continue to maintain a peaceful border once this issue is resolved.
  From ITALY: Hello, France. I agree that no new supply centers were captured last round. I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and am open to continuing our cooperation in the Mediterranean. My plans for next year involve reinforcing my position in the Adriatic and possibly building a new fleet in Naples to make moves in the Ionian Sea. Any mutual actions against Austria or Turkey could be beneficial.
  From RUSSIA: Hello France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and long-term alliance where you focus on Germany while I focus on Austria and Turkey. For the next year, I plan to continue pressuring Austria and Turkey while you should make moves against Germany. Let us keep each other informed.
  From TURKEY: Hello, thank you for reaching out. I am open to exploring ways we can cooperate where our interests align. Given our geographical distance, what specific plans did you have in mind for collaboration?

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, I agree that our joint plan against Germany should be reaffirmed. F ENG will support F BRE if it needs to hold position or move strategically such as to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean (MAO) if it makes sense for our alliance. However, I need to make sure that F ENG primarily holds the English Channel to prevent any unexpected moves. F NTH could indeed be used to support any strategic moves against Germany. Let us coordinate closely.
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and mutual standoff in Belgium. However, your army in KIE is a direct threat to Berlin. It would be in the spirit of our non-aggression pact for you to move A KIE elsewhere such as to HOL or DEN if possible. This would help us maintain a peaceful border. Let us keep our agreement intact and focus on other threats such as England or Italy.
  From ITALY: Dear France, thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. Your suggestion for a joint action against Germany sounds interesting. However, A VIE might be needed for defense against potential threats from Austria or Russia. However, we are open to keeping an eye on Munich and will work together if the situation allows. Let us stay in touch.
  From RUSSIA: I acknowledge your proposal for a coordinated action against Germany. For now, our main focus is on Turkey and Austria, but I am open to a long-term alliance. A MOS could move to WAR if you make a coordinated move against Germany. However, we need a solid plan for such an action to make sure it does not leave us vulnerable elsewhere.

  From GERMANY: Dear France, I see that you currently hold KIE, which is a home supply center for Germany. I would like to propose that you move your unit out of KIE so that Germany can retake it. We have a non-aggression pact and should focus on other regions such as England or Italy. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given that we both have interests in the Mediterranean, is there any way we can cooperate further? Perhaps a joint action against Austria could be beneficial for us both.

  From GERMANY: Dear France, I am concerned about your unit in KIE. It seems that a strong France is a threat to both of us. I propose that you focus on England and Italy while I focus on Russia and Austria. Could you make a non-aggressive move such as supporting a German unit elsewhere or moving your unit out of KIE? Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and work together against common threats.
  From ITALY: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact. Given your strong position, would you be interested in coordinating actions against Germany or any other power? Additionally, any cooperation in the Mediterranean would be beneficial for us both.
  From RUSSIA: Let us continue our long-term alliance where you focus on Germany while I focus on Austria and Turkey.

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, we need a well-coordinated plan for the English Channel. Moving F ENG to NTH is not feasible as F NTH already occupies that sea. Moving F ENG to SKA would make us vulnerable in the English Channel. A possible alternative could be moving F ENG to IRISH SEA if you need access to ENG for a specific plan. However, another part of your message mentions a joint plan if Germany vacates Belgium. However, Belgium is currently under your control, so could you clarify what you mean? Let us make a plan where both of us gain strategic advantages against Germany.
  From GERMANY: Thank you for reaffirming our non-aggression pact. I agree that maintaining a peaceful border is important. However, I have concerns about your unit in Holland (A HOL) being so close to my unit in Burgundy (A BUR). I hope that you make no aggressive moves against KIE or BER. Let us focus on our respective goals while keeping our borders peaceful.
  From ITALY: I confirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. I am open to a cooperative stance in the Mediterranean. However, my main focus is on the Balkans and Turkey. Any action against Austria should be well-coordinated so that I can secure some of Austria's remaining centers such as BUD, GRE, or SER. However, I am primarily focused on countering Turkey.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, I agree that a coordinated action against Germany could be beneficial. I plan to make a move against Germany's A WAR with A MOS if you make a coordinated move against Germany. Let us keep in touch.

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, our alliance against Germany seems to be working well so far. What are your plans for the next year (Winter 1903 builds and Spring 1904 moves)? How can England support you further against Germany? Let us continue to coordinate closely.
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. However, I am concerned about your unit in A HOL and the fact that you hold KIE. I propose that you move A HOL to BEL (if possible) and do not make any aggressive moves towards BER or MUN. It would be beneficial for us if you vacate KIE so that I can retake it. Let us focus on our respective goals and avoid any conflicts.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. France seems strong in the west. Are you interested in a joint action against Germany to reduce their influence?
  From RUSSIA: FRANCE, the situation in the Balkans is progressing well with Austria capturing BUL from Turkey. How is your front against Germany? We should continue our long-term alliance where you focus on Germany while I focus on Austria and Turkey.

  From ENGLAND: Our joint plan against Germany seems to be making good progress. I suggest that we continue our coordinated actions. For the next round, I propose that F ENG could support F BRE if necessary, while F NTH could support any potential French moves into the North Sea or against German units. A YOR could be used to support any land-based actions against Germany if necessary. What specific targets do you have in mind for a joint attack on Germany?
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and agree on a mutual standoff in Belgium and Burgundy. However, I am concerned about your unit in Holland (A HOL) and your control of KIE. It makes sense for us to keep a stable border, but I need a clear understanding of your intentions in the region. Can we agree that you will not make any aggressive moves towards my territories such as Munich or Berlin?
  From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My main focus is currently on Turkey. However, I would be open to a joint action against Austria if you make a specific proposal. Let us keep in touch.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, I acknowledge your proposal for a joint action against Germany or Turkey. My current strategy is to focus on Turkey until the situation in the south is resolved. Once Turkey is sufficiently weakened, a joint action against Germany could be a viable plan where you attack from the west while I make a move from the east. Let us keep in touch and support each other.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

To maintain a balance, I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact, specifically for the English Channel. What are your thoughts on continuing our joint focus on Germany? However, I would like to make sure that your growing strength does not bring any aggressive intentions towards me.
  From GERMANY: Dear France, it is important that our non-aggression pact remains intact. However, I need clarification on your intentions regarding the unit in A HOL and the supply center KIE. Could you assure me that you are not planning any aggressive moves against Germany? We need to make sure that our borders remain secure so that we can focus on our respective goals.
  From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. My main focus is currently on Turkey. However, if you have any specific proposals against another power (such as Austria or Germany), I am open to discussing them.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, your expansion and current power are impressive. I want to reaffirm our long-term alliance where you focus on Germany while I focus on the south. However, any aggressive moves should be well-coordinated so that no single power becomes too dominant. What are your plans for the coming moves?

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1904M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Dear France, your plan against Germany seems reasonable. However, it's important for us to make sure that our actions do not make one of us too dominant. I can support your F BRE into ENG with F NTH and F ENG this round. However, for future rounds, we need a plan that makes sure both of us make balanced gains. I am also open to supporting your F BRE into ENG this round if you agree to support my F ENG into BEL in the next round. Additionally, I am hesitant to make a move with F SKA yet until we have a more concrete plan against Germany where both of us make gains.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and assure you that any defensive moves are only in response to perceived threats. I have no intention of moving against A HOL in Belgium and would prefer to keep the peace on that front while focusing on other matters such as the Russian front. However, it is important that you do not make any aggressive moves towards my units such as A BUR.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My main focus this year will be on Turkey. However, if you have a specific proposal for a joint action against Austria, I am open to hearing it. However, the main priority for us should be to keep Germany in check.
  From RUSSIA: I agree to make a coordinated action against Germany where I will make a move from A MOS to attack WAR. I hope you make a move such as A PAR to BUR or another coordinated move against Germany.

  From ENGLAND: Hello, we should continue our joint plan against Germany. F NTH can support A HOL - KIE if that's your plan for A HOL. F ENG should stay in place to support F BRE in case of any defensive needs. However, if F BRE makes a move, F ENG can support it. Let's keep up the pressure on Germany.
  From GERMANY: Hello France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I agree that A BUR should make a move that does not threaten A PAR. However, A BUR could move to RUH only if you agree to remove A HOL from KIE or make a non-aggression commitment towards our home centers such as BER and MUN. We need to make sure that our borders remain peaceful.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My main focus is currently on Turkey and possibly Austria. I need to keep Germany as a non-aggression partner until 1905, so I am not in a position to support you against Germany at this time. However, once Turkey is neutralized, we should discuss potential joint actions against other powers.
  From RUSSIA: Hello France, our non-aggression pact still stands. However, my main focus for now is on neutralizing Turkey. Once that is done, a coordinated action against Germany could be considered.

  From ENGLAND: Dear France, while we have maintained a non-aggression pact, your growing strength is a concern. We need to make sure that our alliance remains balanced and that other powers do not feel threatened. What are your plans for the Fall 1904 moves phase? I suggest that we need to make a plan that ensures a balanced power distribution on the board.
  From GERMANY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. However, I am concerned about your A HOL unit in KIE. I suggest that my A BUR could move to RUH if you agree to remove A HOL from KIE or make a non-aggression commitment. My main focus is on the east (Russia), so a stable western border would be beneficial for both of us.
  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 still stands. I am currently focusing on Turkey and possibly Austria. Any joint action against Austria could be beneficial once Turkey is neutralized. Let us keep our lines of communication open.
  From RUSSIA: We reaffirm our long-term alliance. However, our immediate priority is to neutralize Turkey first. Once that is done, a coordinated action against Germany could be made. For now, let us make sure that Turkey is dealt with.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Let's keep up the pressure on Germany. My plan for F ENG is to stay put or support any necessary actions against Germany, while F NTH could be used to support any actions against A HOL or F BRE if needed. Let us keep our communication open and make sure our units are well-coordinated.
  From GERMANY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact. A HOL should stay where it is unless there are any aggressive moves. My plans for A BUR and A RUH are primarily defensive. A BUR could stay where it is unless there is a need to make a defensive move such as moving to RUH if A HOL makes a move. A RUH could stay where it is unless there is a need to make a defensive move such as moving to KIE if there is a threat from another power. Let us keep our borders secure.
  From ITALY: Dear France, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. My units A BOH and A TYR are primarily for defensive purposes against Germany and to support any potential action against Turkey. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I might be open to future cooperation against Germany.
  From RUSSIA: Dear France, I reaffirm our long-term alliance. For now, my main focus is on neutralizing Turkey. Once Turkey is neutralized, a coordinated action against Germany could be beneficial. A GAL could be used to make a move against Germany if needed, such as supporting a potential move to BOH or WAR. However, the main focus should be on Turkey for now.

You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 moves phase, there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in Fall 1904, where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria, thus resulting in a swap of these two supply centers between the two powers, persisted through this phase. The lack of center changes indicates that no new captures or significant territorial shifts occurred during this phase.}

Phase: S1905R, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 moves phase, there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in Fall 1904, where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria, thus resulting in a swap of these two supply centers between the two powers, persisted through this phase. The lack of center changes indicates that no new captures or significant territorial shifts occurred during this phase.}
