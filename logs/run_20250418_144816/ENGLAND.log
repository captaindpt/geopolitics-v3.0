  From FRANCE: I agree to your proposal for a non-aggression pact in the English Channel. I will keep F BRE out of ENG if you keep F LON out of ENG as well. This way, we can both focus on other strategic directions.
  From GERMANY: Hello England, I agree to a non-aggression pact where F KIE stays out of HEL and F LON does not threaten our North Sea borders. I think focusing on France could be a mutually beneficial strategy. Perhaps we can discuss a coordinated action against France?
  From RUSSIA: Dear England, your proposal for a peaceful division of Scandinavia sounds reasonable. I agree that I should aim for Sweden while you aim for Norway.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From FRANCE: Greetings, England. To avoid early conflict, I propose that we agree to a peaceful division of the English Channel. If you agree to stay out of the North Atlantic Ocean (MAO), I will stay out of the English Channel (ENG). This should allow us both to focus on other areas of expansion initially.
  From GERMANY: I appreciate our agreement on a non-aggression pact and the alliance against France. Given that France has a fleet in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean and armies in Spain and Burgundy, it seems that France is focusing on westward expansion. I suggest that you keep your fleets in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea for potential support against France. We should coordinate our actions carefully. What are your thoughts on a joint plan for this phase?
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our agreement on the peaceful division of Scandinavia where I aim for Sweden while you aim for Norway. Let us continue to respect this agreement.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From FRANCE: I appreciate your openness to a long-term structured alliance and mutual non-aggression in the English Channel. To make our cooperation more concrete, I propose that we agree that England keeps its fleets out of the English Channel (specifically, no moves into ENG or MAO), while I keep my fleets out of the English Channel (i.e., no moves into ENG). Additionally, a joint plan against Germany could be beneficial. For instance, if I move A BUR to BEL, could you support me by moving A YOR to BEL (which might need a convoy from F NTH)? This would help us both gain a strategic advantage against Germany.
  From GERMANY: Hello England, here is a more detailed plan for our alliance against France and Russia. For the next move, I propose that my fleet in Denmark (F DEN) moves to the Heligoland Bight (HEL) or alternatively, my army in Kiel (A KIE) supports F DEN to HEL if needed. I suggest that your fleet in the North Sea (F NTH) moves to HEL or supports F DEN to HEL. This will help us secure the North Sea and potentially make a joint move against France from the North while I focus on a land assault on France's borders. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From RUSSIA: Hello England, yes, Germany is part of the Northern Triple alliance plan. I aim for Sweden while you aim for Norway. It is important that we keep Germany in the loop so that our actions are well-coordinated. Let us make sure that Germany is on board with this plan as well.

France, England, Turkey, and Italy, having gained one new supply center each in the Fall, built one new unit each. Austria and Russia, having gained two new supply centers, built two new units each. Germany did not make any new builds as it did not gain any new supply centers in the previous phase."}

  From FRANCE: Hello England, we need to reaffirm our agreement on the peaceful split of the English Channel. My fleet in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean could move there unless we agree on a joint plan against Germany. How about you focus on the North Sea and Scandinavia while I keep my fleet in the English Channel? Let us make sure that Germany remains our priority target.
  From GERMANY: We need to make a coordinated effort against France and Russia. Given your fleet in Norway (F NWY), perhaps a joint operation to control the North Sea and Baltic Sea could be beneficial. How about if your F NWY moves to support my F BAL into Sweden (F NWY S F BAL-SWE)? This could help us push back against Russia's F SWE. Additionally, if your F NTH could support an attack on Belgium (F NTH S A RUH-BEL), we could work together to take on France. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: Hello England, our peaceful division of Scandinavia seems to be working well so far. I hope we can continue to honor this agreement and avoid any conflicts in the Baltic Sea region.

Additionally, I would like to reaffirm our agreement for a peaceful division of the English Channel. Let us make sure that our units do not come into conflict there. What are your thoughts on a coordinated attack on Germany this round?
  From GERMANY: Greetings, England. Following our previous discussion regarding a joint effort against France and Russia, I propose that your fleet in Norway supports my Baltic fleet moving into Sweden (F NWY S F BAL-SWE) and that your North Sea fleet supports my army in Ruhr moving into Belgium (F NTH S A RUH-BEL). This would help us make strategic gains against our common adversaries. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  From RUSSIA: Our Northern Triple alliance is working well. I aim to keep my fleet in Sweden while you keep your fleet in Norway. Let us continue to support each other.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From FRANCE: I agree that Germany still poses a significant threat. I plan to move A BUR to RUH if Germany makes any aggressive moves. However, I need assurance that F NTH will not make any aggressive moves against F BRE or F MAO. Let us make sure that our fleets coordinate so that F BRE could support an attack on the English Channel if necessary. How do you plan to support our joint plan against Germany?
  From GERMANY: Given that Russia already has a fleet in Sweden, a coordinated action seems necessary. How about you support my F BAL into Sweden while your F NWY could also support the move or make a move to support us against France? For instance, your F NTH could move to ENG to threaten France's F BRE or support an attack against BUR if needed.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello England, thank you for reaching out. While our main focus is currently on the Balkans and Eastern Europe, I am open to finding ways to cooperate where our interests align. Let us keep a line of communication open for future opportunities.
  From FRANCE: Hello England, I appreciate your reaffirmation of our alliance against Germany. I do not have any units that need to retreat this round. Let us continue to coordinate our efforts. I plan on holding KIE for now unless there is a strategic reason to vacate it. What are your next moves against Germany?
  From GERMANY: Hello England. I understand that you are currently allied with France against me. However, I would like to make a peace offer that makes sense for both of us. If you are open to it, I could support your fleet in the North Sea and perhaps we could make a joint effort against France who currently holds five supply centers. Working together might help us both grow stronger.
  From ITALY: Hello, England. I am open to potential cooperation where our interests align. Currently, I am focused on maintaining a stable position in the Mediterranean and dealing with Austria and Turkey. Perhaps we could explore mutual interests against France or Germany if needed. What are your thoughts?
  From RUSSIA: Hello England, the fleet in Sweden is part of our previously agreed-upon peaceful division of Scandinavia where you aim for Norway while I aim for Sweden. Let us make sure that our Northern Triple alliance remains intact. I have no aggressive intentions against you.

  From FRANCE: Dear England, let us reaffirm our joint plan against Germany. I propose that your fleet in the English Channel (F ENG) supports my fleet in Brest (F BRE) to hold its position or move to another strategic location such as the Mid-Atlantic Ocean (MAO) if necessary. Meanwhile, your fleet in the North Sea (F NTH) could be used to support an attack on the North Sea or another strategic location. Let us keep the English Channel peaceful and focus on our common goal against Germany.
  From GERMANY: Dear England, as previously discussed, I believe that a coordinated action against France could be beneficial for both of us. France currently has an army in KIE which is a threat to my core territories. Could your fleet in NTH support my fleet in SWE if needed? Additionally, any joint action against France could help us both expand and secure our positions.
  From RUSSIA: England, let us reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. I need to make sure that your fleet in NWY does not make any aggressive moves towards STP. What are your plans for F NWY this turn?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From FRANCE: Thank you for your message. To make a coordinated attack against Germany, I propose that your F NTH supports my F BRE to move into the English Channel (ENG) while your F ENG could move into the North Sea (NTH). Meanwhile, my A KIE could attack HOL or RUH if supported properly by my A BUR. Let us make a plan to dislodge the German fleet in SWE and make a push into their heartland. What do you think about this plan?
  From GERMANY: Hello, England. The situation on my end is stable, but France's growing power is indeed a concern. They currently have an army in KIE which is a direct threat to Berlin. I plan to try and dislodge them from KIE. I propose that you keep F NTH in a position that can support us against France and perhaps try to deny them access to the North Sea. Another option could be for you to make a move on F BRE or F GAS. Let's coordinate closely.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance terms. Our main focus this round is to act against Turkey and possibly make a strategic move against Germany if an opportunity arises. Any actions in Scandinavia will be peaceful.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From FRANCE: Thank you for your continued support. It would be helpful if F ENG could support any potential moves such as A BUR to RUH or A HOL to RUH if necessary. Let us keep up the pressure on Germany together.
  From GERMANY: I am glad to see you are open to a joint action against France. To make a coordinated attack, I suggest that your fleet in the North Sea could support my fleet in Sweden if France makes a move, while I could support your actions in the English Channel if you move against France's fleets. Another option could be for your fleet in the North Sea to move to the Baltic Sea where it can help us secure the north against any potential Russian moves while we focus on KIE and possibly Belgium. What do you think?
  From ITALY: Hello England, my main goal for the next round is to secure the Mediterranean and make strategic moves against Austria and Turkey. I am open to any potential cooperation that aligns with this goal. What are your current intentions and how do you see us working together?
  From RUSSIA: The Northern Triple alliance remains important. To support against Germany and France, I need to make sure that my southern front is secure. Once that is in place, I can make more aggressive moves against Germany's eastern front. For now, I plan to keep A STP and A MOS ready to make a move if necessary.

Another possibility is if Germany vacates Belgium, we should make a joint plan to secure it for one of us. What do you think?
  From GERMANY: Dear England, a strong France is a threat to both of us. I propose a joint plan against France. Could you support my F SWE to hold its position or make a coordinated attack on France's F SPA/NC or F GAS? Let us work together to contain France's expansion.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. I plan to make no aggressive moves against your unit in Skagerrak (F SKA) and hope that you make no aggressive moves against my unit in St. Petersburg (A STP). What are your thoughts on this plan for the Fall 1903 movement phase?

  From FRANCE: Our alliance against Germany is indeed working well. For Fall 1903, I plan to make a move on BUR with A PAR. Could F ENG support F BRE to hold its position or make a move to the English Channel if necessary? Additionally, I suggest that F SKA should make a move on Sweden (F SKA to SWE) while F NTH supports F SKA to SWE if necessary. A HOL could support any potential English moves into Belgium if needed.
  From GERMANY: I agree that France is becoming a dominant power in Western Europe. A temporary truce or coordination against France makes sense. However, I need to keep control of Sweden (F SWE). If you need to make a move on Sweden, it could jeopardize our potential alliance against France. Perhaps we should find another way for you to expand your power. How about focusing on Belgium or Holland instead? Your fleet could support my A BUR move to Holland and we could work together against France.
  From RUSSIA: Dear England, the Northern Triple alliance is holding well. I plan to make sure that A STP supports any moves you make against Germany's F SWE. Let us keep coordinating against Germany and France.

  From FRANCE: Our joint plan against Germany seems to be making progress. I suggest we continue our coordinated actions. How do you propose we proceed in the next round? Perhaps a joint attack on Germany could help us both expand further.
  From GERMANY: Dear England, I hope our non-aggression pact still stands. I am concerned about your fleet in SKA which could potentially threaten SWE. I request that you do not make a move on SWE and instead focus on attacking France's units in the west such as F BRE and F SPA/NC. A joint action against France could be beneficial for both of us.
  From RUSSIA: ENGLAND, our Northern Triple alliance has been useful for us both. How are your plans for the next year? Do you need any support from me in the north? What should be our next steps?

  From FRANCE: Dear England, our alliance against Germany is indeed working well. For Winter 1903, there should be no need for any builds or disbands as no centers changed ownership. For Spring 1904, I plan to move A PAR to BUR (if Germany agrees to move A BUR elsewhere), F BRE to ENG (with support from F NTH if possible), and F SPA/NC could support F BRE to ENG or move to MAO. A HOL could stay in place or move to BEL if that makes strategic sense. How can we best coordinate our moves against Germany? Perhaps F NTH could support F BRE to ENG.
  From GERMANY: Dear England, I am glad to hear that you are open to a well-coordinated plan against France. I aim to retake KIE and possibly make a move towards Holland. If you could make a significant push in the North Sea or the English Channel, it would put pressure on France from multiple fronts. Let us discuss a more specific plan where both of us make significant gains against France.
  From ITALY: Dear England, thank you for your message. I am open to future cooperation where our interests align. For now, my main focus is on the Balkans and the Mediterranean. However, if there is a strategic opportunity for us to cooperate against France or Germany in the future, I am open to discussing that as well.
  From RUSSIA: Dear England, I reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. Currently, my main focus is on securing the southern front against Turkey. Once that situation is resolved, a coordinated action against Germany could be considered where you make a move from the north while I make a move from the east. Let us make sure our alliance remains strong.

You are ENGLAND, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter 1903 adjustments phase, no new supply centers changed hands. The main activity was likely the building or disbanding of units based on the current supply center counts for each power. France, now holding nine supply centers after acquiring Holland and Spain, may have added a new unit, while Turkey and Austria might have made unit adjustments based on their new supply center totals after their exchange of Greece and Bulgaria."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From FRANCE: Dear England, let us reaffirm our joint plan against Germany. I propose that you use F ENG and F NTH to support my F BRE into ENG so that we can jointly control the English Channel. Additionally, it would be great if you make a move with F SKA to support an attack on SWE (currently held by Germany). Together, we can put significant pressure on Germany.
  From GERMANY: Dear England, as previously discussed, a joint plan against France seems beneficial for both of us. How should we coordinate our fleets in the North Sea and Baltic against France? Perhaps you could move F Ska to support F SWE, while I make sure that A BUR keeps pressure on French borders.
  From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. Once the situation with Turkey is stabilized, I am open to future cooperation against major powers like France or Germany.
  From RUSSIA: Dear England, the Northern Triple alliance has been beneficial for us so far. Given France's growing power, what are your plans for F NTH and F ENG? It might be in our mutual interest to make sure that France does not become too dominant.

  From FRANCE: Dear England, I am glad that our alliance has been fruitful thus far. I also want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact specifically for the English Channel. My intentions are not aggressive towards you; instead, I want to continue our joint focus on Germany until they are sufficiently weakened. Let us make sure that the English Channel remains a peaceful zone unless we both agree upon a joint action. What are your thoughts?
  From GERMANY: I agree that France poses a significant threat to our interests. I propose a coordinated plan where I could move A BUR to RUH (if not directly attacking) and potentially support any moves you make against French units such as F BRE or A HOL. Additionally, I need your support for a potential move to KIE if that supply center is still in question. Let us continue our cooperation to curb France's expansion.
  From ITALY: I understand your concerns about France. However, my current focus is on resolving the situation with Turkey first. Once that is addressed, I am open to future cooperation against France or Germany if necessary. Let us keep in touch.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that France is a significant threat. Once our southern front against Turkey and Italy is secure, I am willing to make a coordinated effort against France. Let us keep the Northern Triple alliance strong.

  From GERMANY: England, let us continue our joint plan against France and Russia. I propose that we coordinate an attack on France's unit in HOL and aim to retake KIE. Can you support me in the North Sea and Baltic Sea? What are your plans for F SKA?
  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact until 1905 remains in place. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to cooperating against France or Germany. For now, any support against France would be appreciated if it aligns with your plans.
  From RUSSIA: Hello England, I want to reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. Once the southern front is secure, we should make a coordinated action against France. How do you see our current situation?

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1904R
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From FRANCE: England, our alliance should indeed remain strong. To make sure other powers do not perceive us as a single threat, we need to make a strategic plan. I suggest that we make a coordinated move against Germany this round. For instance, you could support my A HOL to RUH while I support your F NTH to HEL. This way, we make a joint effort against a common enemy while making sure that our actions are seen as a part of a broader strategy rather than a direct threat to others. What do you think?
  From GERMANY: Germany agrees that France has grown too powerful and that a stronger alliance against France is necessary. I propose a plan where your fleets (F NTH, F ENG, F SKA) could support an attack on France's F BRE or F GAS while I try to retake KIE and make a move on A HOL. You should also try to make a move on F SPA/NC or A POR. Let us make a concerted plan to target France's units and supply centers.
  From ITALY: Dear England, I acknowledge that France is a significant threat with 8 supply centers. I am willing to cooperate against France once the situation with Turkey is resolved. For now, my main focus is on the southern front (Turkey and possibly Austria). However, once Turkey is neutralized, I would be open to a future alliance against France. Let us keep in touch.
  From RUSSIA: Dear England, I acknowledge that France has become a dominant power with 8 supply centers. Once Turkey is neutralized, a coordinated effort against France could be a valid next step. For now, our main focus should be on neutralizing Turkey.

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are ENGLAND, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring 1904 retreats phase (S1904R), no units were dislodged in the previous moves phase, so no retreats were necessary. The board state remains the same as it was after the Spring 1904 moves phase, with no changes in unit positions or supply center ownership."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1904M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: F NTH, F ENG, F SKA, A WAL
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "BUD"], ["F", "SMY"], ["A", "SER"]], "ENGLAND": [["F", "NTH"], ["F", "ENG"], ["F", "SKA"], ["A", "WAL"]], "FRANCE": [["A", "POR"], ["F", "GAS"], ["F", "BRE"], ["F", "SPA/NC"], ["A", "HOL"], ["A", "PAR"], ["F", "MAR"]], "GERMANY": [["F", "SWE"], ["A", "WAR"], ["A", "MUN"], ["A", "BUR"]], "ITALY": [["A", "ROM"], ["A", "BOH"], ["F", "ALB"], ["F", "ION"], ["A", "TYR"], ["A", "VIE"]], "RUSSIA": [["F", "RUM"], ["A", "STP"], ["A", "MOS"], ["A", "GAL"]], "TURKEY": [["F", "BLA"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "ANK"], ["A", "BUL"]]}
  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "BUL", "SER"], "ENGLAND": ["EDI", "LON", "LVP", "NWY"], "FRANCE": ["BEL", "BRE", "HOL", "KIE", "MAR", "PAR", "POR", "SPA"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "MUN", "SWE", "WAR"], "ITALY": ["NAP", "ROM", "TRI", "TUN", "VEN", "VIE"], "RUSSIA": ["MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "STP"], "TURKEY": ["ANK", "CON", "GRE", "SMY"]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From FRANCE: Let's continue our joint plan against Germany. What specific actions should we take this turn? I suggest that your fleets in ENG and NTH could help us by supporting moves against Germany's units or supply centers such as BER or MUN.
  From GERMANY: Dear England, it seems that France has a significant presence in the North Sea and the English Channel. Given that you have a fleet in Ska (F SKA) and a fleet in the North Sea (F NTH), could we coordinate a joint action against France? For instance, if you move F SKA to support F SWE to hold or move to DEN, it could help us both in securing the Baltic region. Additionally, if you need any support from my F SWE, please let me know.
  From ITALY: I am currently focusing on resolving the situation with Turkey. Once that is done, I am open to future cooperation against France or Germany. Keep me informed of your plans and intentions.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. France's growing power is a concern. Once Turkey is neutralized, we should make a coordinated effort against France. Any immediate actions to check France's expansion would be helpful.

  From FRANCE: Dear England, I understand your concerns about my growing strength. However, a strong France can be a valuable ally against Germany. Our main focus is on Germany, and I propose a joint plan where you focus on the northern part such as supporting an attack on Denmark or Sweden while I focus on the southern part such as moving A HOL to KIE or A PAR to BUR. Let us make sure that our alliance remains strong and balanced.
  From GERMANY: I agree that France is a significant threat. Let us make a coordinated effort to curb France's expansion. I propose that your fleets (F NTH, F ENG, F SKA) could support my A BUR to move into BEL if France's A HOL moves out of KIE. Alternatively, you could make a move on Brest or Gascony while I try to retake KIE or make a move on BEL.
  From ITALY: I agree that France is a significant threat. However, my main focus right now is on Turkey. Once that situation is resolved, I am open to forming an alliance against France. Let us keep in touch.
  From RUSSIA: I share your concern about France's growing power. However, our immediate priority should be to neutralize Turkey first. Once that is done, a coordinated effort against France could be made. For now, let us reaffirm the Northern Triple alliance and make plans for a future action against France.

  From FRANCE: Let's keep up the pressure on Germany. I plan to make a move on Belgium if necessary and make sure that our units are coordinated. Any specific plans for F ENG and F NTH?
  From GERMANY: England, I would like to discuss a joint plan against France. The unit F SKA could be a significant asset in our coordinated efforts. Perhaps you could use F SKA and F NTH to support moves against French units such as A HOL or F BRE. What specific plan do you have for fleet coordination in the North Sea and Baltic against France? Let us work together to counterbalance French power.
  From ITALY: Once we resolve the situation with Turkey, I am open to future cooperation against France or Germany. For now, our main focus is on the south.
  From RUSSIA: Dear England, I hope you are well. I want to reaffirm our Northern Triple alliance. Once the southern front is secure, I propose a coordinated action against France. What are your plans for the next round, and how can I support you further?

  From GERMANY: Dear England, I agree that France's power is a significant threat. Here is a plan: F SWE could move to DEN to threaten KIE. A RUH could move to KIE if France does not make a move on us. A BUR could support A RUH to KIE or move to PAR if France makes an aggressive move. I suggest that F NTH supports F SKA to move to DEN, F SKA moves to DEN, F ENG moves to BEL or supports an attack on BEL, and A WAL supports an attack on BEL or moves to LON for defense. What do you think?
  From ITALY: Dear England, I acknowledge that France has become a significant threat with 8 supply centers. Once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to cooperating against France. For now, my main focus is on neutralizing Turkey. Once that is done, I could potentially redirect forces to support you against France.
  From RUSSIA: Dear England, I acknowledge that France is now the dominant power on the board. Once the situation with Turkey is more stable, I am willing to make a concerted effort against France. For now, my main focus is on neutralizing Turkey. What are your specific plans against France and how do you plan to coordinate with other powers such as Germany or Italy?
  From TURKEY: Thank you for reaching out. I agree that France's growing power is a concern. Once I stabilize my situation against Austria and Italy, I would be open to a broader alliance against France. For now, my main priority is to secure my borders and recapture Smyrna from Austria.

You are ENGLAND, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 moves phase, there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in Fall 1904, where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria, thus resulting in a swap of these two supply centers between the two powers, persisted through this phase. The lack of center changes indicates that no new captures or significant territorial shifts occurred during this phase.}

You are ENGLAND, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 moves phase, there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in Fall 1904, where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria, thus resulting in a swap of these two supply centers between the two powers, persisted through this phase. The lack of center changes indicates that no new captures or significant territorial shifts occurred during this phase.}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From FRANCE: Dear England, our joint plan against Germany has been successful so far. However, it is important that we continue to work together. I need to regain control of Belgium. Could you please vacate F BEL so that I can move A HOL to BEL? This will help us both focus on a coordinated attack against Germany. Let us make sure that our fleets in the North Sea and the English Channel do not come into conflict.
  From GERMANY: Dear England, I want to reaffirm our joint plan against France. F SWE should move to DEN to threaten KIE, and A RUH should move to KIE if France does not make a move on us. F NTH should support F SKA to move to DEN, and F ENG should move to BEL or support an attack on BEL. Let's make sure our plan is still on track.
  From ITALY: Dear England, once the situation with Turkey is resolved, I am open to future cooperation against France or Germany. Let us keep in touch.
  From RUSSIA: Hello England, I hope our Northern Triple alliance still holds. Let us continue to make coordinated moves against France once the southern front is secure.
