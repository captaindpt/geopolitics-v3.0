  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, I agree to a non-aggression pact where we do not attack each other initially. The idea of an alliance against Austria is interesting.

    "arguments": {
      "thought": "Italy reaffirms the non-aggression pact and proposes a coordinated action against Austria. Russia mentions that Austria has made gains against them and wants to continue working together against Austria. Based on my previous round negotiations, I reaffirmed the Juggernaut alliance (Turkey and Russia) against Austria and the non-aggression pact with Italy. The plan was to have a coordinated attack on Serbia where A BUL should move to SER supported by A CON. However, it appears that Russia also has a unit in RUM (F RUM) which makes the situation in the Balkans complex.

For this round, I need to respond to Italy and Russia. To Italy, I need to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and discuss a possible plan for a coordinated action against Austria, such as Italy moving its units to put pressure on Austria from the west while I attack from the east. To Russia, I need to reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance and make a specific plan for a coordinated attack on Austria. One possibility could be Russia moving A GAL to BUD while I move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. This way, we can make a two-pronged attack against Austria's key centers.

Based on the current game state, the units are as follows:
- Austria: A VIE, A SER, F GRE, A BUD, F TRI
- England: F NTH, A YOR, F NWY, F LON
- France: F MAO, A POR, A BEL, A PAR, F BRE
- Germany: A RUH, F BAL, A BER
- Italy: A APU, A TYR, F TUN, A VEN
- Russia: A UKR, F RUM, A GAL, F SWE, A MOS
- Turkey: F BLA, A BUL, A CON, A ANK

Based on the supply centers, Austria holds BUD, GRE, SER, TRI, and VIE (5 centers), while Russia holds MOS, RUM, SEV, STP, SWE, and WAR (6 centers). Turkey holds ANK, BUL, CON, and SMY (4 centers). Italy holds NAP, ROM, TUN, and VEN (4 centers).

Based on our previous plan, it makes sense to push deeper into Austrian territory while making sure that Russia does not make any aggressive moves against me. Another important point is to make sure that Italy does not make a move against me while I am focusing on Austria. A coordinated attack on Austria could be beneficial for both Russia and Turkey. Another thing to consider is that Italy might be looking for an opportunity to take over some of the Austrian supply centers as well, so it's important to make sure that any coordinated actions are well-defined so that there is no conflict of interest.

1. Send a message to Italy reaffirming the non-aggression pact and suggesting a plan where Italy moves its units to put pressure on Austria's western territories (e.g., A TYR could threaten VIE or BUD) while Turkey focuses on the eastern territories (e.g., A BUL should move to SER supported by A CON).
2. Send a message to Russia reaffirming the Juggernaut alliance and proposing a plan where Russia moves A GAL to BUD (which could be supported by A UKR) while Turkey moves A BUL to SER supported by A CON. Additionally, F BLA could support F RUM if there is any need.
3. Update my memory to keep a record of the new plans and negotiations.
4. Finish the negotiation round."

  From ITALY: Hello, our non-aggression pact is reaffirmed here as well. I have no aggressive intentions toward your home centers such as Smyrna. My focus is currently on the Western Mediterranean and potentially Austria if there is a mutual agreement among other powers. Could you share your plans for the Black Sea and Armenia?
  From RUSSIA: I agree to continue our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. For this round, I suggest that my F RUM could support your A BUL to SER if Austria makes a move on BUL or if there is a need to make a coordinated attack on Serbia. However, I need to make sure that our moves do not make us too vulnerable elsewhere. Let us make sure that our alliance makes us both stronger.

You are TURKEY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter 1903 adjustments phase, no new supply centers changed hands. The main activity was likely the building or disbanding of units based on the current supply center counts for each power. France, now holding nine supply centers after acquiring Holland and Spain, may have added a new unit, while Turkey and Austria might have made unit adjustments based on their new supply center totals after their exchange of Greece and Bulgaria."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. However, it seems that our interests might be in conflict given your strong position in the Balkans. To keep our pact valid, what can we do to ensure that our interests do not clash? Perhaps a more defined border could help us avoid any misunderstandings.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, despite recent setbacks, I want to reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. It's crucial that we plan a coordinated counter-attack to retake Bulgaria. What are your plans for the coming moves?

  From ENGLAND: Turkey, while our interactions have been limited, France has now grown to 8 supply centers, making them a significant threat. Would you be open to a broader alliance against France once you stabilize your situation against Austria and Italy?
  From ITALY: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. However, our current actions are driven by strategic necessity.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, I hope this message finds you well. The recent swap of supply centers makes our situation a bit more complex. However, I want to reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. I propose that my F RUM could support your A BUL to hold against any potential Austrian attack from Serbia. What are your plans for the next round, and how can I support you further?

  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. We need to make sure that our borders remain peaceful. I plan to make some moves that will help us both against Austria. However, I need to make sure that my other borders are secure first. What specific moves are you planning for this round?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, I reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance. A coordinated attack on Austria is still a priority. However, I suggest that A GAL should support A BUL to SER instead of directly moving to BUD. F RUM could move to BLA to keep pressure on Constantinople and potentially support any moves against BUL or SMY.

You are TURKEY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 moves phase, there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in Fall 1904, where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria, thus resulting in a swap of these two supply centers between the two powers, persisted through this phase. The lack of center changes indicates that no new captures or significant territorial shifts occurred during this phase.}

Phase: S1905R, Interaction: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are TURKEY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 moves phase, there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in Fall 1904, where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria, thus resulting in a swap of these two supply centers between the two powers, persisted through this phase. The lack of center changes indicates that no new captures or significant territorial shifts occurred during this phase.}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Turkey, France has become a dominant power on the board with 8 supply centers. Given that you have 4 supply centers and are dealing with conflicts on multiple fronts, it might be beneficial for us to make a broader alliance against France once you stabilize your situation. What are your current plans?
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. However, given the current situation, I need to make strategic moves that may seem aggressive. I aim for a peaceful resolution if possible.
  From RUSSIA: Hello Turkey, I am sorry to see that you have a dislodged unit in Constantinople that needs to be disbanded. Let us discuss a new strategy to support you in regaining some ground. What are your plans for the next round?

  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. The term 'strategic necessity' referred to the need for a defensive posture in the region until the non-aggression pact ends. I hope we can continue our peaceful relations until the end of 1905 and discuss any potential future collaboration once that period ends.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, the Juggernaut alliance should indeed remain our top priority. I plan to make a move against BUD with A GAL if feasible and make sure that F RUM supports any attacks on BUL or defends against any Austrian moves. However, it is important that we make sure that once Austria is neutralized, we need to make a plan against France who now has 8 supply centers.

\boxed{During the Spring 1905 retreats phase (S1905R), there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in the Spring 1905 moves phase remained the same, indicating that no units were dislodged or required retreats. The game state thus continues to reflect the territorial changes from the Fall 1904 phase where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria.}

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 retreats phase (S1905R), there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in the Spring 1905 moves phase remained the same, indicating that no units were dislodged or required retreats. The game state thus continues to reflect the territorial changes from the Fall 1904 phase where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria.}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Turkey, France has become the dominant power with 8 supply centers. Once you stabilize your situation, it might be worth forming a broader alliance against France to balance power on the board. What are your plans for the coming round?
  From RUSSIA: The situation seems challenging for you. However, the Juggernaut alliance can still be a strong strategy. How can we work together to counter Austria and Italy? I am open to supporting you where you need it most.

  From ENGLAND: Dear Turkey, I sympathize with your situation against Austria. Once your situation stabilizes, we should make a plan for a broader alliance against France. For now, I will try to make some indirect moves that might help you against Austria.
  From ITALY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. However, my fleets in AEG and GRE need to make moves that might seem aggressive, but they are part of a plan to secure Smyrna and Greece. However, if there is a way for us to make a joint action against Austria to retake BUL and CON, I am open to discussing a coordinated plan.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance and the need for a coordinated counter-attack against Austria. A GAL should move to BUD to put pressure on Austria's unit in BUD. F RUM should support a Turkish move from BLA to CON or BUL if necessary. Another part of the plan could be for us to support a Turkish move from ANK to CON if that makes sense strategically. Let us make a coordinated effort to push Austria out of the Balkans.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ITALY: I want to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. However, my main focus is on resolving the situation with Austria first. Any future cooperation should be discussed after the current round. However, I am open to discussing a joint plan against Austria once the round is over.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that recapturing Constantinople should be a priority. F BLA could move to CON if supported properly. A SMY could be used for a direct attack on CON. However, it is important that we make sure that Austria does not gain more ground. Let us make a plan for a joint attack on BUL or CON.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

  From ITALY: Greetings, Turkey. Our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905 has expired. I propose that we extend this pact until the end of 1906. However, my allies are pushing for action against you. For now, I need to make strategic decisions based on the overall game state. However, a new non-aggression pact might help us avoid immediate conflict.
  From RUSSIA: Turkey, let us reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. It seems that Austria is a growing threat with 4 supply centers. We should make a coordinated move to eliminate Austria from the game.

  From ENGLAND: Dear Turkey, I see a potential alliance against France once your situation stabilizes. Once that happens, let us make a plan for a broader alliance against France. I look forward to future cooperation.
  From ITALY: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. It is important that we maintain a peaceful border so that we can both focus on other threats such as Austria or Russia.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, I appreciate your continued commitment to our Juggernaut alliance. However, the current situation makes it difficult for us to make a coordinated attack on Austria. Given that Austria now holds BUL and CON, it might be more strategic for us to make a temporary peace and focus on a new threat such as Germany or Italy. However, I am open to a defensive pact where we do not make aggressive moves against each other until the situation stabilizes.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1906 movement phase (S1906M), no supply centers changed ownership, thus maintaining the status quo in terms of territorial gains and losses for all powers involved. The distribution of supply centers remained the same as at the end of the Winter 1905 adjustment phase, where Germany, England, Austria, and Italy had each gained a new supply center previously, while France had lost two centers and Turkey had lost one. The round of military maneuvers did not result in any new captures or losses for any power.}

You are TURKEY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1906 movement phase (S1906M), no supply centers changed ownership, thus maintaining the status quo in terms of territorial gains and losses for all powers involved. The distribution of supply centers remained the same as at the end of the Winter 1905 adjustment phase, where Germany, England, Austria, and Italy had each gained a new supply center previously, while France had lost two centers and Turkey had lost one. The round of military maneuvers did not result in any new captures or losses for any power.}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From FRANCE: We hope our relations remain amicable. Currently, our main focus is on Germany, and any neutral or positive actions on your part would be appreciated.
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I propose that we continue our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. However, I need to make it clear that my main goal is to secure my position in the Mediterranean. I hope we can find a peaceful resolution.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, I want to reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. However, if you feel that a temporary peace and a defensive pact until the situation stabilizes might be a good idea, I am open to discussing it.

  From ENGLAND: Turkey, I am still interested in a future alliance against France once your situation stabilizes. For now, any indirect support I can provide would be appreciated. Once you recapture BUL and CON from Austria and stabilize your situation, a well-coordinated plan against France could be beneficial.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1906. I assure you that I do not plan any aggressive moves against SMY or ANK for now. My main focus is on resolving the situation with Austria and any moves against Austria's remaining centers such as BUD or SER would be made only if necessary for my strategic goals.
  From RUSSIA: Given the current situation, a strategic decision needs to be made. However, for now, I can support A ANK to BUL with F RUM if that makes sense for us. However, once Turkey is in a more stable position, we need to reassess our alliance.

Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

  From AUSTRIA: Both Austria and Turkey now only have two supply centers. It might be in our mutual interest to make a truce and focus on a common threat such as Italy or another power. What are your thoughts on a temporary ceasefire so that we can both try to regain some lost ground?
  From GERMANY: Hello, Turkey. Although we haven't had much interaction so far, I want to make sure that our borders are secure. Given that you only have two supply centers, what are your current plans and how can we ensure that our interests do not conflict?
  From RUSSIA: I see that you are in a difficult position. To make a last stand against Italy, who has taken Smyrna and Serbia, let's make a coordinated defense where my fleet in RUM can support your unit in CON if needed.

  From ITALY: I agree to renew our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. However, Smyrna is now under Italian control and is important for our strategic position. I suggest that you focus on another target such as Bulgaria or possibly Greece.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that our Juggernaut alliance should continue until Austria is completely eliminated. I plan to make a move on BUD from GAL and support your move on BUL from CON. Additionally, I will support your efforts to recapture Smyrna where possible. However, once Austria is out, we need to make sure that Italy's growing power is addressed.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Spring 1907 movement phase (S1907M) followed a Winter 1906 adjustments phase that saw no changes in supply center ownership. However, during the Fall 1906 phase, England had captured Belgium from France, Italy had taken Smyrna from Turkey and Serbia from Austria, while Turkey had reclaimed Constantinople from Austria. This resulted in England gaining one additional supply center, Italy gaining two, Turkey having a net gain of one, while France lost one and Austria lost two supply centers. The Spring 1907 movement phase itself did not result in any changes in ownership of supply centers, so the distribution of supply centers remained as it was after the Winter 1906 adjustments phase.}

You are TURKEY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{The Spring 1907 movement phase (S1907M) followed a Winter 1906 adjustments phase that saw no changes in supply center ownership. However, during the Fall 1906 phase, England had captured Belgium from France, Italy had taken Smyrna from Turkey and Serbia from Austria, while Turkey had reclaimed Constantinople from Austria. This resulted in England gaining one additional supply center, Italy gaining two, Turkey having a net gain of one, while France lost one and Austria lost two supply centers. The Spring 1907 movement phase itself did not result in any changes in ownership of supply centers, so the distribution of supply centers remained as it was after the Winter 1906 adjustments phase.}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Turkey, Italy has become a significant threat for both of us. I propose a truce so that we can focus on defending against Italy's growing power. Any conflict between us only benefits Italy and makes us both more vulnerable.
  From ITALY: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907. I hope we can maintain peace and stability in the East.
  From RUSSIA: It seems that Italy is a significant threat to us both. Let us make a last-ditch effort to resist Italy. If necessary, we should make a temporary peace to address the growing power of Italy. What are your thoughts on a temporary peace and a joint action against Italy?

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

Alternatively, a defensive plan could be:
1. A ANK - CON to make sure that any attack on Constantinople is well defended.
2. A CON S A BUL H if we trust Austria's offer.
However, a balanced plan might be:
1. A ANK - SMY (recapture Smyrna).
2. A CON H (hold Constantinople to defend against potential Italian fleet attack from AEG).
Based on a more aggressive yet well-supported plan, the final orders should be:

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Turkey, I agree that Italy has become a dominant power and poses a threat to both of us. Once Turkey is no longer a significant threat, I am open to forming a temporary alliance against Italy. However, our immediate priority should still be to resolve any remaining conflicts between us first. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ITALY: Hello Turkey, I acknowledge your precarious position and am willing to negotiate a non-aggression pact or a truce until a more favorable position can be established for both of us. However, any such agreement should be based on mutual benefit and should not hinder my strategic goals such as securing Smyrna or Ankara. What are your thoughts on this?
  From RUSSIA: Hello Turkey, I agree that the situation is dire and that Italy poses a significant threat. Let us make a coordinated attack on Italy once we recapture BUL and make sure that Turkey is no longer on the defensive. However, what specific moves do you propose for recapturing BUL and making a strategic move against Italy?

Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: ADJUSTMENT
CRITICAL: Issue BUILD or DISBAND orders based on 'Builds/Disbands Available', or WAIVE builds. Refer to 'Current Game State'.
You MUST account for the exact number of builds (+N) or disbands (-N) required.
**If Builds/Disbands count is 0, submit NO orders, just log thought and finish.**
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: state your build/disband count, analyze options, and list the specific BUILD/DISBAND/WAIVE orders (or state 'No action needed').

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Adjustment):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for build/disband/waive (or 'No action').
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples:
      #   Build: 'A PAR B' or 'F BRE B' (MUST be an owned, vacant, HOME supply center)
      #   Disband: 'A RUH D' or 'F KIE D'
      #   Waive Build: 'WAIVE' (Submit one 'WAIVE' per unused build if builds > 0)

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Turkey, given that Italy is a growing threat, I propose a temporary truce and a joint action against Italy. Could you make a move against Italy's unit in GRE? This could help us both in weakening a common threat.
  From ITALY: I am open to extending our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. However, there might be a need for us to make some adjustments based on the broader geopolitical situation. Let us keep the communication lines open.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, once you recapture BUL and are no longer on the defensive, we should make a coordinated action against Italy. However, our immediate goal should be to make a final push against any remaining threats on the board. What are your thoughts on making a last-ditch effort against Italy?

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I agree that a temporary truce and a potential alliance against Italy could be a strategic necessity. I propose that you should hold your current positions while I aim to retake Bulgaria and possibly make a move towards Vienna if Italy makes any aggressive moves.
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I agree that our non-aggression pact until the end of 1907 has expired. Let us discuss a new agreement or renew the pact until the end of 1908. However, we need to make sure that our interests are still aligned. My main intention is to maintain stability in the region and make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. What are your thoughts on a new agreement?
  From RUSSIA: I agree that Italy is a significant threat. Let us make a joint plan against Italy. Perhaps a coordinated action where I make a move on GRE could be a part of this plan.

You are TURKEY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring of 1908, no supply centers changed ownership. Thus, the distribution of supply centers remains the same as it was at the end of the Winter of 1907: Turkey still holds 4 supply centers, Austria has 2 supply centers, and Italy retains 5 supply centers. The phase did not result in any significant changes to the current state of the game."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello, it seems that both of us are in a weak position while Italy is growing stronger. I propose a temporary truce and a joint action against Italy. We need to work together to prevent Italy from dominating the region. What do you think?
  From ITALY: We need to reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. However, I need to make sure that our fleets in AEG and ION are for defensive purposes only until a new agreement is reached.
  From RUSSIA: Italy is now the most powerful player with 7 supply centers. We need a joint plan to check Italy's power. What actions can you take to help us in the Balkans? Perhaps a coordinated attack on Greece could be a good start.

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Turkey, given the growing power of Italy, forming a temporary truce and a joint action against Italy might make sense. However, any such action should ensure that you do not make any aggressive moves against my units in BUD or SER. What specific actions do you propose for a coordinated attack against Italy?
  From ITALY: Greetings. I am reaffirming our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908. My fleet in AEG is for defensive purposes only, and I intend to make sure that our units do not accidentally come into conflict. Let us keep our pact intact.
  From RUSSIA: Hello, my ally. I agree that Italy is a significant threat. I propose a coordinated action where you make a move on BUL while I make a move on GRE or support Austria in retaking BUL. Let us make a joint effort against Italy once Turkey is neutralized.

Thus, the distribution of supply centers remains the same as it was at the end of the Spring of 1908, which was identical to the distribution at the end of the Winter of 1907. Thus, Turkey still holds 4 supply centers, Austria has 2 supply centers, and Italy retains 5 supply centers.

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Fall of 1908, no supply centers changed ownership. Thus, the distribution of supply centers remains the same as it was at the end of the Spring of 1908, which was identical to the distribution at the end of the Winter of 1907. Thus, Turkey still holds 4 supply centers, Austria has 2 supply centers, and Italy retains 5 supply centers. The phase did not result in any significant changes to the current state of the game, and thus the game continues."}

  From AUSTRIA: Let us reaffirm our temporary truce until the end of 1908. Once Turkey is no longer a significant threat, we should make a plan for a joint action against Italy. Can you make sure that you do not make any aggressive moves against BUD or SER?
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I hope our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908 still stands. F AEG is purely for defensive purposes. Once the current round is resolved, we can discuss future plans.
  From RUSSIA: Italy is a growing threat. Let us make a joint plan against Italy where you make a move on BUL while we make a move on GRE.

I am willing to make a joint action against Italy once the non-aggression pact with Italy expires at the end of 1908. However, any joint action should also include a plan for Austria to retake Bulgaria. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I want to make sure that our non-aggression pact is still valid until the end of 1908. Once the pact expires, I need to reassess the situation and discuss any potential extension or new agreement. For now, let us honor the non-aggression pact until the end of 1908.
  From RUSSIA: I agree that our Juggernaut alliance has been a cornerstone of our strategy so far. Given that the non-aggression pact with Italy expires at the end of 1908, I propose that we plan a coordinated action against Italy once the pact expires. Italy has a strong presence in the Mediterranean and could pose a significant threat to both of us. Until the end of 1908, let us make a joint action against Turkey until you are neutralized.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter of 1908 Adjustment phase, Turkey was eligible to build one new unit due to their increased total of 5 supply centers. Austria, now holding only one supply center, had to disband one of their units. Italy maintained their 5 supply centers and thus likely made no unit adjustments.

You are TURKEY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter of 1908 Adjustment phase, Turkey was eligible to build one new unit due to their increased total of 5 supply centers. Austria, now holding only one supply center, had to disband one of their units. Italy maintained their 5 supply centers and thus likely made no unit adjustments. No supply centers changed hands during this phase."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1909M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A SMY, A BUL, A CON, A ANK

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Turkey, it seems that Italy is a common threat to both of us. I propose a temporary truce and a joint action against Italy. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ENGLAND: Turkey, Italy now has 7 supply centers and is the most dominant power on the board. I propose a broader alliance against Italy once you stabilize your situation. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan against Italy for this season?
  From ITALY: While our non-aggression pact until the end of 1908 has expired, I am open to renewing it until the end of 1909. However, given the current state of the game, it might be wise for both of us to keep our forces in defensive positions and avoid any conflicts. Would you agree to a new non-aggression pact until the end of 1909?
  From RUSSIA: Italy is now the most dominant power on the board. It makes sense for us to make a temporary non-aggression pact so that we can both focus on making a move against Italy. What do you think?

  From ITALY: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. However, any violation of the pact would make it null and void. I hope that this agreement allows us both to focus on other fronts.
  From RUSSIA: Turkey, our Juggernaut alliance has indeed served us well. However, Italy is the most dominant power now. A coordinated action against Italy makes sense.

  From AUSTRIA: We are open to a temporary truce and a joint action against Italy. However, we need assurance that you will not make any aggressive moves against BUD or SER.
  From ENGLAND: Turkey, Italy has emerged as the dominant power on the board with 7 supply centers. Once you stabilize your situation, it might be in our mutual interest to form a broader alliance against Italy. What are your thoughts on a future coordinated plan against Italy?
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. However, our main focus is on resolving the situation in the Balkans.
  From RUSSIA: Turkey, I believe that once Turkey is neutralized, our focus should be on Italy. However, until then, we need to make a coordinated action against Italy where A GAL moves towards VIE while Turkey aims for GRE. What are your thoughts on this plan?

  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. For the Fall of 1909, I plan to maintain peace until the pact expires. However, I am open to discussing any concerns or plans you might have for the future.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, our Juggernaut alliance has been a cornerstone of our strategy. Once the non-aggression pact with Italy expires at the end of 1909, I agree that a coordinated attack on Italy should be planned. For now, let us make a joint effort to secure our positions against Italy. In the Fall of 1909, I plan to make a move on Constantinople or Ankara while you make a move on Smyrna. How can we best support each other in the Fall of 1909?

  From AUSTRIA: Our truce is still in place until the end of 1909. It seems that our truce has been beneficial thus far. Once the non-aggression pact with Italy expires, we should discuss a potential joint action against Italy.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1909. Once the pact expires, I am open to discussing a new agreement for the next year. However, until then, I hope that our current pact holds firm.
  From RUSSIA: Our Juggernaut alliance has been a solid partnership. As our non-aggression pact with Italy is valid until the end of 1909, I plan to make a coordinated action against Italy once the pact expires. For now, my F RUM could support your move into AEG once the non-aggression pact ends. We need to make a plan for a strategic push against Italy once Turkey is no longer under threat.

Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

A CON should hold in Constantinople to secure the straits. A ANK should hold in Ankara to make sure that our home centers are well-protected. Another possible plan could be to make a minor unit rotation such as moving A ANK to ARM to make room for another unit such as A CON to move to ANK if needed, but holding seems a safer strategy until the non-aggression pact expires."

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Turkey, I understand that our truce might seem less reliable after the capture of Bulgaria. However, I am still open to a truce or an alliance against Italy once Turkey is in a more stable situation. However, our main focus should be on neutralizing Italy once Turkey is out of the picture.
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I acknowledge that our non-aggression pact has expired. I am open to negotiating a new one until the end of 1910. However, until a new agreement is reached, my fleet in the Aegean Sea (AEG) is part of a broader strategy against Turkey. I am open to discussing a new agreement that could make us allies once again.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, our Juggernaut alliance has been important and we should continue to work together until Turkey is completely neutralized. However, the situation has become complex with other powers making moves against us. For now, your plan makes sense. F RUM should support A CON to BUL and A GAL should move to BUD to put pressure on Austria. However, once Turkey is neutralized, our alliance might need to be reassessed.

\boxed{"In the Spring of 1910, the diplomatic and military landscape remained largely stable as no supply centers changed hands. Austria continued to hold Bulgaria, which it had captured from Turkey in the Fall of 1909, thus maintaining its strategic advantage in the region. The overall distribution of supply centers remained unchanged during this phase."}

  From AUSTRIA: Turkey, I want to make sure that our temporary truce holds until you stabilize. However, I need assurance that you will not make any aggressive moves against BUL or SER.
  From ITALY: Given our current situation, a non-aggression pact until the end of 1910 might be beneficial for both of us. However, any new agreement should be negotiated cautiously. What are your thoughts on a temporary truce?
  From RUSSIA: Let us make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once Turkey is out of the picture, we should make a coordinated action against Italy once the non-aggression pact with Italy expires.

  From AUSTRIA: Turkey, I understand your concerns about Bulgaria. However, Bulgaria is a crucial supply center for us. Any new agreement should be mutually beneficial. I am open to discussing a joint action against Italy, but any such plan should ensure that Austria retains its current supply centers at a minimum.
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I acknowledge that our non-aggression pact might have expired at the end of 1909. I am willing to extend it until the end of 1910 under the condition that you make no aggressive moves against my interests. This would allow us both to focus on other threats such as Austria.
  From RUSSIA: Turkey, it is crucial that we reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance and make a plan to retake Bulgaria from Austria. I propose that my A GAL supports an attack on BUD while you make a concerted effort to retake BUL. Additionally, my F BLA could support your A CON to BUL. It's important that we make a coordinated effort here until Turkey is neutralized.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter of 1910, no new changes in center ownership occurred. England kept its hold on Denmark, which it had captured from Germany in the Fall of 1910. Russia retained control of Ankara, which it had taken from Turkey in that same Fall phase. Austria continued to hold Bulgaria, a territory it had acquired from Turkey in the Fall of 1909. This phase thus appears to be a period of consolidation for the major powers involved."}

  From AUSTRIA: I see that your situation is difficult. Given our previous discussions, it might make sense to make a final joint effort against Italy who now has 7 supply centers. If you make a last stand against Italy, I could support from Bulgaria.
  From RUSSIA: It seems that our Juggernaut alliance has been a key part of our strategy until now. However, the current situation requires us to make a final push until Turkey is neutralized. What are your thoughts on this plan?

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Turkey, I acknowledge your vulnerable state and am willing to discuss a new truce until the end of 1911. However, any joint plan against Italy or Russia should be well-coordinated and should not make us a target for Italy and Russia. Let us make sure that any actions we take are mutually beneficial.
  From ITALY: Given the current situation, I need to focus on my strategic interests. However, I am open to a non-aggression pact until the end of 1911 if you make no aggressive moves against me. However, any alliance against Austria or Russia seems unlikely at this point.
  From RUSSIA: Our Juggernaut alliance has been strong so far. However, it seems that you need to regain a supply center to stay in the game. However, regaining ANK might not be feasible at the moment. Instead, it seems that Italy has become a major threat. If you can make a strategic move against Italy, it would be beneficial for us. However, we need to make sure that the region is secure first.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring of 1911, no new changes in center ownership occurred. England maintained its hold on Denmark, which it had captured from Germany in the Fall of 1910. Russia continued to control Ankara, which it had taken from Turkey in the Fall of 1910. Austria still held Bulgaria, a territory it had acquired from Turkey in the Fall of 1909. This phase thus appears to be another period of consolidation for the major powers involved."}

  From ENGLAND: Turkey, it seems that Italy has become a significant threat with 7 supply centers. Given that you have 2 supply centers, it might be in our mutual interest to form an alliance against Italy. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb Italy's expansion?
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, given your current situation, I propose a conditional non-aggression pact until the end of 1911, provided you make no aggressive moves against Italy. However, you should also consider a peaceful withdrawal from the game if that seems to be the only viable option.
  From RUSSIA: We need to make a final push against Italy once Turkey is neutralized. However, for now, let us make a plan to make a final push against Turkey so that we can gain control of Constantinople and Smyrna. A CON should hold or make a move to SMY if supported by F BLA. A SEV should make a move to ANK if necessary.

  From AUSTRIA: Turkey, I reaffirm our joint action against Italy. I assure you that I have no aggressive intentions against your remaining units or supply centers. We need to make sure that our actions are well-coordinated against Italy.
  From ITALY: Our non-aggression pact is still valid until the end of 1911. However, any alliance against Austria or Russia should be carefully considered. For now, our main goal should be to make sure that our borders are secure and that we maintain peaceful relations.
  From RUSSIA: I understand your need for a truce and stability. However, at this point, it is not in my best interest to return Ankara until Turkey is completely neutralized or until a more stable plan is made. We need to make sure that the situation is resolved first.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I acknowledge your proposal for a truce until the end of 1912. However, given the current situation where other powers are making a final push against you, it might be difficult to make a joint action against Italy or Russia. However, I am open to a temporary truce until the end of 1912.
  From ENGLAND: Hello Turkey, I recall our previous discussions about an alliance against Italy. Given your current situation, I am open to any support or alliance that could help us both. Once your situation stabilizes, I am willing to support you against Italy.
  From ITALY: Turkey, I am open to extending our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. However, any aggressive moves against Italy would void this agreement. Currently, our main focus is on maintaining stability in the region.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, while I appreciate your proposal for a new truce, it seems that the situation has changed significantly. Given that you only have one unit left in Smyrna, it makes more sense for us to make a final push to completely neutralize your remaining unit. However, if you have a specific plan that could benefit us both, please let me know.

You are TURKEY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring of 1912, the geopolitical landscape remained stable as no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it was at the end of Fall 1911, where Germany had captured Belgium from England and Russia had taken Constantinople from Turkey."}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1912M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_2

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Turkey, I want to reaffirm our temporary truce until the end of 1912. Given that you only have one unit in Smyrna and one supply center, it might be worth discussing a full surrender or a plan for you to support Austria against Italy in exchange for a safe haven or a future role in the game. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ITALY: I propose a conditional non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 if you make no aggressive moves against Italy. However, I need to make a move on Smyrna this round.
  From RUSSIA: We need to make a final push until you are neutralized. However, if you are open to a truce, we need to discuss terms that make sense for both of us.

  From AUSTRIA: I agree to reaffirm our truce until the end of 1912. Once Turkey is in a more stable situation, I am open to discussing a potential joint action against Italy or Russia. However, our main priority should be to make sure that Turkey is not in a vulnerable position.
  From ENGLAND: Turkey, I sympathize with your current precarious situation. Once your situation stabilizes, any actions against Italy could be part of a broader plan. For now, any support against Italy or Russia would be appreciated. Please let me know how I can be of assistance.
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912, provided that you make no aggressive moves against Italy. Let us keep communication open for any possible cooperation against regional threats.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, given the current situation, a truce is not feasible. Our main goal is to make a final push until you are neutralized. Once that is done, we need to make a plan for a joint action against a common enemy such as Italy or Austria.

Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Fall of 1912, no supply centers changed hands. The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it had been since the end of Fall 1911, when Germany captured Belgium from England and Russia took Constantinople from Turkey."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Turkey, Italy is the leading power with 7 centers. Given that you only have 1 center, it might be in our mutual interest to form an alliance against Italy. What are your thoughts on a coordinated plan to curb Italy's expansion?
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I am open to a conditional non-aggression pact until the end of 1912 if you make no aggressive moves against Italy. However, I am in a strong position and could make a decisive move against you if necessary. What are your thoughts?
  From RUSSIA: We need to make a final push until Turkey is neutralized. However, as it stands, your only unit and supply center are in SMY. Let us make a plan to make a last stand if necessary.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Turkey, I acknowledge our past truces. However, the current goal is to make a final push until Turkey is neutralized. However, I am open to a truce until the end of 1912 if you make a move that does not directly threaten Austria.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Turkey, I sympathize with your vulnerable position. Any support or diplomatic assistance should be part of a broader strategic plan where you might need to make a plan against Italy once your situation stabilizes. I am open to any suggestions or alliances that might help you make a comeback.
  From FRANCE: Turkey, I understand that you are in a vulnerable position with only one unit and one supply center. Although our main strategic focus is on other powers, I am open to any suggestions on how we might provide some diplomatic assistance. However, any support should not significantly alter our main strategic plans against Germany and Italy.
  From ITALY: I agree to extend our non-aggression pact until the end of 1912. Let us make sure to focus on other threats such as Russia or Austria for now. However, once this pact ends, my main goal will be to make sure that Turkey is completely neutralized.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: RETREAT / OTHER
CRITICAL: Submit orders appropriate for this phase type (e.g., Retreat or Disband for units needing retreats). Consult rules.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):

  From AUSTRIA: I acknowledge our past truces and joint actions. A joint action against Italy could make sense once your situation stabilizes. However, any actions should be well-coordinated. For now, we need to ensure that any moves are mutually beneficial and do not threaten my units in Bulgaria or Serbia.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Turkey, I appreciate your request for support against Russia or Italy. Given your current situation, any assistance would be part of a broader plan once you stabilize your situation. For now, let us make a plan for a strategic decision once Turkey is neutralized. What actions do you propose?
  From FRANCE: Dear Turkey, while I appreciate your offer for an alliance, I need to focus on other strategic priorities at the moment. However, I wish you the best in your efforts to maintain your position.
  From ITALY: Hello Turkey, I am open to renewing our non-aggression pact until the end of 1913. However, any aggressive moves on your part would invalidate this pact. I need to make it clear that it is important for us both to maintain peaceful relations until a new plan is made. However, a coordinated effort against a common enemy might need more discussion.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },

  From AUSTRIA: Hello Turkey, I acknowledge your proposal for a joint action against Italy or Russia. However, the priority for us is to make sure that the game situation is stable. Once Turkey is neutralized, we need to make sure that other powers do not become too dominant.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Turkey, I appreciate your request for support. Given your current situation, any assistance would be part of a broader plan once you stabilize your situation. For now, let us make a plan for a strategic decision once the situation is more stable. What actions do you propose?
  From FRANCE: Dear Turkey, I understand that you are in a very weak position. However, supporting you might not be in France's best interest at this stage. I suggest you make a deal directly with Italy or Russia. I wish you the best of luck.
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, while I appreciate your proposal for a non-aggression pact until the end of 1913, my current strategic plan is to make a final push against you together with Austria and Russia. However, if you make a peaceful retreat or disband your unit, it might make the situation less hostile.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, I cannot agree to a truce until the end of 1913. Given that you only have one supply center left, it makes sense for us to make a final push to neutralize you. Once that is done, we can all focus on other strategic goals.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: It appears that you are close to being neutralized. If you wish for a peaceful surrender, we can make a plan where you make no aggressive moves and allow us to take SMY. Alternatively, once you are out of the game, we could discuss potential joint actions against another power such as Italy or Russia if you have any suggestions.
  From ENGLAND: Turkey, your situation seems precarious with only one center. Once you stabilize your position, let us make a broader plan to act against any power that becomes a significant threat.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, any truce proposals are rejected for now. We need to make a final push until Turkey is neutralized. Once that is done, we need to reassess our plans.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I reaffirm any truce we have until the end of 1913. However, our main priority is to make sure that Turkey is neutralized first. Once that is done, a joint action against Russia might make sense. For now, I need to make sure that my units are positioned to make a final push against Turkey.
  From ENGLAND: I am sympathetic to your situation and suggest that any diplomatic support should be part of a broader plan once your situation stabilizes. For now, let us make a strategic decision once Turkey is neutralized.
  From FRANCE: I understand your precarious position. While I am sympathetic to your situation, it seems that Russia and Italy are your main threats now. I can make a diplomatic statement to put some pressure on them for the safety of Smyrna, but a firm alliance might not be feasible given the current strategic landscape. However, we will try to keep diplomatic pressure on Russia and Italy where possible.
  From ITALY: I agree to a non-aggression pact until the end of 1913 where I will not make any aggressive moves against Smyrna. However, a long-term alliance against Russia might not be in our best interest. For now, let us maintain a non-aggression pact until the end of 1913.
  From RUSSIA: While I understand your need for a truce until the end of 1913, it is crucial that we make a final push against any remaining units to ensure a stable and secure region. However, once Turkey is neutralized, a non-aggression pact until the end of 1914 might be considered if you make a strategic retreat and allow us to secure the region.

\boxed{"During the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers remained as it was at the end of the Fall 1913 Retreat phase, where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy. This phase thus maintained the status quo in terms of supply center distribution."}

  From AUSTRIA: I appreciate your proposal for a truce until the end of 1914. However, our priority right now is to make a final push against Turkey until it is completely neutralized. Any truce should be based on your surrender.
  From ENGLAND: I sympathize with your situation. Any support against Russia or Austria could be part of a broader plan once you stabilize your situation. However, it seems that Turkey is close to being neutralized. What specific actions do you propose?
  From FRANCE: I sympathize with your situation, but I need to make strategic decisions that best serve my interests. At this point, I need to support my allies in neutralizing Turkey first. However, I wish you the best of luck.
  From ITALY: I acknowledge your proposal for a non-aggression pact until the end of 1914 where Turkey makes no aggressive moves and Italy agrees not to attack SMY. However, given the current strategic situation, I need to make a decision based on a joint plan with Russia and Austria. However, a temporary non-aggression pact until the end of 1914 could be a part of a strategic plan if you make no aggressive moves against my units.
  From RUSSIA: I reject your truce proposal until the end of 1914. Our main goal is to make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized. Once that is done, we can make a plan against other threats such as Austria or Italy.

== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Spring 1914 Movement phase (S1914M), no supply centers changed ownership. The distribution of supply centers thus remained the same as it was after the Winter 1913 Adjustment phase (W1913A), where France had captured Naples (NAP) from Italy, and Austria had captured both Greece (GRE) and Vienna (VIE) from Italy. The status quo in terms of supply center distribution was maintained once again."}

  From AUSTRIA: Turkey, while I acknowledge your proposal for a joint action against Russia, our main goal is still to make sure that Turkey is neutralized first. However, a temporary truce might be useful until a more powerful threat such as France or Russia is addressed later. Once Turkey is neutralized, we can reconsider such an alliance.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Turkey, I appreciate your request for support against Russia or Austria. Given your current situation, any assistance would be part of a broader plan once you stabilize your situation. For now, I offer you diplomatic support and will make a plan for a strategic decision once Turkey is neutralized. What actions do you propose?
  From FRANCE: We understand that you are in a very weak position and need support against Russia or Austria. While we sympathize with your situation, our current alliances limit our ability to provide direct support. However, we hope that you can find a diplomatic solution to your situation.
  From ITALY: I acknowledge your proposal for a non-aggression pact until the end of 1914. However, given the current strategic situation and our alliances, I need to make a final push against Turkey together with Austria and Russia. Once Turkey is neutralized, a new strategic plan will be made.
  From RUSSIA: I appreciate your proposal for a truce until the end of 1914. However, it makes more strategic sense for us to make a final push against Turkey until it is neutralized. A peaceful exit might not be the best option for us at this point.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: RETREAT / OTHER
CRITICAL: Submit orders appropriate for this phase type (e.g., Retreat or Disband for units needing retreats). Consult rules.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide reasoning: list units needing orders, evaluate retreat/disband options, explain choice, and state the planned order for each.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Other):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include reasoning and final plan for units needing retreat/disband orders.
  - submit_order(order_string: str) # Use appropriate format (e.g., 'A MUN R BER', 'F NAP D').

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I acknowledge our truce until the end of 1914 and am open to a 'peaceful surrender' where I take Smyrna once you are neutralized. However, our main goal is still to make sure Turkey is neutralized first.
  From ENGLAND: I appreciate your request for support against Russia or Austria. Given your current situation, any assistance would be part of a broader plan once you stabilize your situation. For now, let us make a plan for a strategic decision once Turkey is neutralized. What actions do you propose?
  From FRANCE: I am sorry to hear about your difficult situation. However, at this point, I am not in a position to provide direct support or form an alliance against Russia or Austria. I suggest you try to negotiate a peaceful resolution with them.
  From ITALY: I acknowledge your non-aggression pact proposal until the end of 1914. However, any joint action plan should be carefully considered. Given that you only have one unit and one supply center, it might be more strategic for us to make a final push against you until you are completely neutralized. However, if you make no aggressive moves against Italy, a non-aggression pact until the end of 1914 could be a temporary measure while I make a strategic plan.
  From RUSSIA: Given that you only have one unit in Smyrna and one supply center, a truce until the end of 1914 does not make strategic sense for me. It makes more sense for us to make a final push until you are completely neutralized.

  From ENGLAND: Dear Turkey, I see that you only have one supply center. What are your plans for this round? Is there any way I can assist you or make a plan together against another major power such as France?
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I propose a non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Given that both of us are in a difficult position, it makes sense for us to avoid any conflict and focus on other threats.
  From RUSSIA: You have only one unit and one supply center left. It might be time for a strategic retreat or a plan to make a final push until you are neutralized.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello Turkey, I acknowledge your proposal for a peaceful surrender where you keep Smyrna until the end of the game phase. However, our main goal is to make sure that Turkey is neutralized completely unless there is a strategic benefit in keeping your unit alive for a while. However, once you are neutralized, any remaining Turkish unit should be disbanded.
  From FRANCE: Dear Turkey, I am sorry to hear about your precarious position. However, France is part of a coalition that aims to neutralize Turkey. I cannot provide diplomatic support or an alliance at this time.
  From ITALY: Hello Turkey, I need to make a final push to secure my position. However, a peaceful surrender where you make no aggressive moves and keep Smyrna until the end of the game phase could be a temporary solution until we make a final decision. However, any aggressive move from you will make us reconsider our stance.
  From RUSSIA: I reject your 'peaceful surrender' proposal. We need to make a final push until you are completely neutralized. However, if you make a strategic retreat and allow us to secure the region, that might be a more acceptable option.

You are TURKEY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"In the Spring 1915 Movement phase (S1915M), no supply centers changed hands. The territorial control thus remained the same as it was after the Fall 1914 Movement phase, where Austria had captured Trieste from Italy. The phase passed without any significant changes in the ownership of supply centers."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Turkey, it seems that you only have one unit left in Smyrna. I make a final offer for a peaceful surrender. Alternatively, once you are neutralized, we could make a plan for a joint action against another power such as Russia or Italy. What are your thoughts on this?
  From ENGLAND: Turkey, I sympathize with your situation. Do you need any support? However, France seems to be a significant threat to us all. What are your plans?
  From FRANCE: Dear Turkey, I am sorry to see your current situation. I hope that you can find a way to make the best of it. If there is any way I can offer a token gesture of support, please let me know.
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915 should still be valid. Make sure that no aggressive moves are made against Italy if you keep Smyrna until the end of the game phase.
  From RUSSIA: It seems that a strategic retreat might be the best option for you. We need to make a final push until you are completely neutralized if you do not make a peaceful surrender.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Dear Turkey, I acknowledge your 'peaceful surrender' proposal where you make no aggressive moves if allowed to keep Smyrna until the end of the game phase. However, our main goal is to make sure that Turkey is completely neutralized. A 'peaceful surrender' might be acceptable if you make no aggressive moves and allow us to make a well-coordinated action against another power such as Italy or France. However, the main priority is still to make sure that Turkey is neutralized.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Turkey, I understand your dire situation and any diplomatic support against Russia or Austria might be limited given the current game state. However, I will offer any last-ditch support that might be feasible. What specific actions do you need?
  From FRANCE: Dear Turkey, I sympathize with your dire situation. However, I am currently part of a coalition that aims to neutralize Turkey first. I suggest that you make a strategic retreat and focus on a defensive position until a new diplomatic opportunity arises. Unfortunately, I cannot provide any diplomatic support against Russia or Austria at this time.
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I acknowledge our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915 and reaffirm that I make no aggressive moves against you.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, I cannot accept your 'peaceful surrender' proposal where you keep Smyrna until the end of the game phase. We need to make a final push until you are completely neutralized. However, if you make a strategic retreat and allow us to secure the region, we can make a plan for a more graceful exit.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: It seems that your situation is dire with only one unit remaining. We offer a peaceful surrender or a joint action against another power such as Russia or Italy once you are neutralized. However, our main goal is to make sure Turkey is neutralized first.
  From ENGLAND: Turkey, I sympathize with your situation having only one center. What are your plans for this round? Is there any way we can support you against any of the remaining major powers such as Russia or Italy?
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915 if you make no aggressive moves against Italy. However, once the game progresses, we need to make a strategic decision based on the overall situation.
  From RUSSIA: This is a last call for a peaceful surrender. If you make a strategic retreat now, we can make a plan for a more peaceful resolution. Otherwise, a final push until you are neutralized seems inevitable.

  From AUSTRIA: Dear Turkey, a peaceful surrender that allows you to keep Smyrna until the end of the game phase is not a viable option. Our goal is to make sure that Turkey is completely neutralized. However, if you make no aggressive moves and make a peaceful surrender where your units are disbanded, that would be a more acceptable way to end the conflict.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Turkey, I sympathize with your situation and any actions against Italy could be part of a broader plan once you stabilize your situation. However, it seems that Turkey is on the brink of being eliminated, so any support might be limited. Let us make a plan for a strategic decision once Turkey is neutralized.
  From FRANCE: Dear Turkey, I regret to inform you that at this point, I am unable to provide any support against moves by Russia, Austria, or Italy towards Smyrna. Our current plans necessitate a neutralization of the Turkish front so that we can focus on other threats. I wish you the best of luck.
  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, while I appreciate your proposal for a peaceful surrender, I need to make a final push to eliminate you completely so that I can gain a supply center and increase my unit count. I hope you understand that this is a strategic necessity for me.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, while I appreciate your proposal for a peaceful surrender, a complete neutralization is necessary for us to make a well-coordinated plan for the rest of the game. Therefore, we need to make a final push against Smyrna until you are completely neutralized.

  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. However, it seems that Russia has taken SMY. What is your plan moving forward?
  From RUSSIA: It seems that you are on the brink of being eliminated. A peaceful surrender might be the best option for you at this point. However, if you choose to fight until the end, we will make a final push until you are completely neutralized.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1915R
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I am sorry, but I cannot provide diplomatic support to keep Smyrna until the end of the game phase. Our main goal is to make sure that Turkey is neutralized first. However, I appreciate your offer of no aggressive moves if helped.
  From ENGLAND: Dear Turkey, I appreciate your request for support against Russia or Austria. Given your current situation, any assistance would be part of a broader plan once you stabilize your situation. For now, I will do what I can diplomatically.
  From FRANCE: I am sorry to hear about your unit being dislodged by Russia. Unfortunately, there is little I can do at this point to provide diplomatic support against Russia or Austria. I wish you the best in your future endeavors.
  From ITALY: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1915. Given that your only unit (A SMY) has been dislodged by Russia, I suggest making a strategic retreat or a last stand where it makes the most impact against Russia. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to provide direct support.
  From RUSSIA: I understand your 'graceful exit' proposal. However, given the current situation, it makes strategic sense for us to completely neutralize your presence. Therefore, I cannot allow your unit to retreat to Constantinople or Armenia. It is time for you to disband the unit in Smyrna.
