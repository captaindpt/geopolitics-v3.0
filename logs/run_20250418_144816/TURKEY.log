  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, I agree to a non-aggression pact where we do not attack each other initially. The idea of an alliance against Austria is interesting.

    "arguments": {
      "thought": "Italy reaffirms the non-aggression pact and proposes a coordinated action against Austria. Russia mentions that Austria has made gains against them and wants to continue working together against Austria. Based on my previous round negotiations, I reaffirmed the Juggernaut alliance (Turkey and Russia) against Austria and the non-aggression pact with Italy. The plan was to have a coordinated attack on Serbia where A BUL should move to SER supported by A CON. However, it appears that Russia also has a unit in RUM (F RUM) which makes the situation in the Balkans complex.

For this round, I need to respond to Italy and Russia. To Italy, I need to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and discuss a possible plan for a coordinated action against Austria, such as Italy moving its units to put pressure on Austria from the west while I attack from the east. To Russia, I need to reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance and make a specific plan for a coordinated attack on Austria. One possibility could be Russia moving A GAL to BUD while I move A BUL to SER supported by A CON. This way, we can make a two-pronged attack against Austria's key centers.

Based on the current game state, the units are as follows:
- Austria: A VIE, A SER, F GRE, A BUD, F TRI
- England: F NTH, A YOR, F NWY, F LON
- France: F MAO, A POR, A BEL, A PAR, F BRE
- Germany: A RUH, F BAL, A BER
- Italy: A APU, A TYR, F TUN, A VEN
- Russia: A UKR, F RUM, A GAL, F SWE, A MOS
- Turkey: F BLA, A BUL, A CON, A ANK

Based on the supply centers, Austria holds BUD, GRE, SER, TRI, and VIE (5 centers), while Russia holds MOS, RUM, SEV, STP, SWE, and WAR (6 centers). Turkey holds ANK, BUL, CON, and SMY (4 centers). Italy holds NAP, ROM, TUN, and VEN (4 centers).

Based on our previous plan, it makes sense to push deeper into Austrian territory while making sure that Russia does not make any aggressive moves against me. Another important point is to make sure that Italy does not make a move against me while I am focusing on Austria. A coordinated attack on Austria could be beneficial for both Russia and Turkey. Another thing to consider is that Italy might be looking for an opportunity to take over some of the Austrian supply centers as well, so it's important to make sure that any coordinated actions are well-defined so that there is no conflict of interest.

1. Send a message to Italy reaffirming the non-aggression pact and suggesting a plan where Italy moves its units to put pressure on Austria's western territories (e.g., A TYR could threaten VIE or BUD) while Turkey focuses on the eastern territories (e.g., A BUL should move to SER supported by A CON).
2. Send a message to Russia reaffirming the Juggernaut alliance and proposing a plan where Russia moves A GAL to BUD (which could be supported by A UKR) while Turkey moves A BUL to SER supported by A CON. Additionally, F BLA could support F RUM if there is any need.
3. Update my memory to keep a record of the new plans and negotiations.
4. Finish the negotiation round."

  From ITALY: Hello, our non-aggression pact is reaffirmed here as well. I have no aggressive intentions toward your home centers such as Smyrna. My focus is currently on the Western Mediterranean and potentially Austria if there is a mutual agreement among other powers. Could you share your plans for the Black Sea and Armenia?
  From RUSSIA: I agree to continue our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. For this round, I suggest that my F RUM could support your A BUL to SER if Austria makes a move on BUL or if there is a need to make a coordinated attack on Serbia. However, I need to make sure that our moves do not make us too vulnerable elsewhere. Let us make sure that our alliance makes us both stronger.

You are TURKEY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{"During the Winter 1903 adjustments phase, no new supply centers changed hands. The main activity was likely the building or disbanding of units based on the current supply center counts for each power. France, now holding nine supply centers after acquiring Holland and Spain, may have added a new unit, while Turkey and Austria might have made unit adjustments based on their new supply center totals after their exchange of Greece and Bulgaria."}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ITALY: Reaffirming our non-aggression pact until 1905. However, it seems that our interests might be in conflict given your strong position in the Balkans. To keep our pact valid, what can we do to ensure that our interests do not clash? Perhaps a more defined border could help us avoid any misunderstandings.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, despite recent setbacks, I want to reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. It's crucial that we plan a coordinated counter-attack to retake Bulgaria. What are your plans for the coming moves?

  From ENGLAND: Turkey, while our interactions have been limited, France has now grown to 8 supply centers, making them a significant threat. Would you be open to a broader alliance against France once you stabilize your situation against Austria and Italy?
  From ITALY: We reaffirm our non-aggression pact until the end of 1905. However, our current actions are driven by strategic necessity.
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, I hope this message finds you well. The recent swap of supply centers makes our situation a bit more complex. However, I want to reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance against Austria. I propose that my F RUM could support your A BUL to hold against any potential Austrian attack from Serbia. What are your plans for the next round, and how can I support you further?

  From ITALY: Dear Turkey, I reaffirm our non-aggression pact until 1905. We need to make sure that our borders remain peaceful. I plan to make some moves that will help us both against Austria. However, I need to make sure that my other borders are secure first. What specific moves are you planning for this round?
  From RUSSIA: Dear Turkey, I reaffirm our Juggernaut alliance. A coordinated attack on Austria is still a priority. However, I suggest that A GAL should support A BUL to SER instead of directly moving to BUD. F RUM could move to BLA to keep pressure on Constantinople and potentially support any moves against BUL or SMY.

You are TURKEY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
Analyze the situation, communicate if in negotiation, and prepare appropriate actions (messages or orders) according to the phase type and available tools.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
\boxed{During the Spring 1905 moves phase, there were no reported changes in supply center ownership. The territorial situation established in Fall 1904, where Turkey captured Bulgaria from Austria while losing Smyrna to Austria, thus resulting in a swap of these two supply centers between the two powers, persisted through this phase. The lack of center changes indicates that no new captures or significant territorial shifts occurred during this phase.}
