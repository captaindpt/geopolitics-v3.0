== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 1

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json

Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From FRANCE: I agree to a DMZ in the English Channel for this round. However, I suggest that we both should also avoid any aggressive moves towards Belgium until a mutual agreement is reached.
  From GERMANY: Hello, England. I agree to a bounce in the North Sea if I plan to move my fleet there. To ensure a peaceful start, I also suggest that you should not move into Denmark or Holland this year.
  From RUSSIA: I agree to your proposal where you secure Norway while I focus on Sweden and the Baltic Sea. However, I need assurance that you will not make any moves on St. Petersburg. Let us make a mutual non-aggression pact for the first year where you do not move into St. Petersburg and I do not move into Norway.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1901M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From FRANCE: I agree that a DMZ in the English Channel (ENG) for this round makes sense for both of us. This allows us to focus on other strategic areas. I plan to make moves in the Iberian Peninsula and possibly Belgium. Let us keep our agreement.
  From GERMANY: Hello England, I agree to reaffirm our agreement for a DMZ in the North Sea (NTH) for this round. This will help us both focus on other strategic areas. I suggest that you focus on Norway and Sweden while I aim for Holland and Belgium.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our agreement where you take Norway (F NWG-NWY) and I take Sweden (F BOT-SWE). I will support your move to Norway if necessary. Let us make sure that our actions are well-coordinated.

== YOUR PRIVATE NOTES (Memory) ==
{
  "S1901M_prop": "Agreed to DMZ in ENG with France for this round, agreed to DMZ in NTH with Germany for this round, and agreed to a division of Scandinavia with Russia where England takes Norway and Russia takes Sweden.",
  "F1901M_prop": "Reaffirmed DMZ in ENG with France, agreed to avoid Belgium. Reaffirmed DMZ in NTH with Germany, supported Germany's aim for Holland and Belgium. Reaffirmed plan with Russia where Russia takes Sweden and England takes Norway with support from F NTH."

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "F MAO - SPA" } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "A PIC S F MAO - SPA" } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "A MAR H" } },
  { "tool_name": "finish_orders", "arguments": {} }
]
```

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.

Now, provide your JSON response:
