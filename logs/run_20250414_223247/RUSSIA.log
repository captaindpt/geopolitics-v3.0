  From ENGLAND: Hello, Russia. I am interested in securing Norway while you focus on Sweden and the Baltic Sea. What do you think?
  From GERMANY: Hello, Russia. To avoid early conflict, I propose a DMZ in Silesia for this round. Additionally, I would like to make sure that you do not move into Berlin or Prussia. What do you think?
  From TURKEY: Hello, Russia. To avoid an immediate conflict in the Black Sea, how about we agree on a Black Sea bounce this year? This means you move F SEV to BLA and I move F ANK to BLA, which would result in a standoff and prevent any early aggression. This could give us time to discuss further cooperation.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I am open to a joint attack on Turkey. Italy has proposed a Lepanto opening where I move F TRI to ADR while they move F NAP to ION and A VEN to APU. How can we coordinate our actions? Perhaps you could move A WAR to GAL and F SEV to BLA to put pressure on Turkey from the north.
  From ENGLAND: I agree to a division of Scandinavia where I take Norway and you take Sweden. Let us make sure that our fleets do not conflict in the North Sea.
  From GERMANY: Hello, Russia. I agree to a non-aggression pact and a DMZ in the Baltic Sea for this year. To ensure a peaceful start, I also suggest that you should not move into Warsaw or Prussia this year.

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello Russia, I hope you are well. I see that you have a fleet in Sevastopol and an army in Ukraine. Are you still on board for a joint attack on Turkey? I suggest that you move your fleet from Sevastopol to the Black Sea so that we can coordinate an attack on Bulgaria or Constantinople.
  From ENGLAND: Let us reaffirm our agreement where England takes Norway and Russia takes Sweden. I plan to move my fleet in the Norwegian Sea (NWG) to Norway (NWY) if you can support me if necessary.
  From GERMANY: Hello, I hope our previous agreement for a DMZ in the Baltic Sea still stands. I suggest that you focus on the Balkans or Turkey while I aim for Holland and Belgium. Let us avoid any conflicts in the Baltic Sea and work together to secure our respective areas.
  From TURKEY: Hello, I would like to reaffirm our agreement for a DMZ in the Black Sea for the Fall 1901M phase. This should help us both focus on other strategic areas without worrying about a conflict in the Black Sea.

== YOUR PRIVATE NOTES (Memory) ==
{
  "S1901M_proposals": "Proposed division of Scandinavia with England (Russia takes Sweden, England takes Norway), non-aggression pact and DMZ in the Baltic Sea with Germany, joint attack on Turkey with Austria (A SER-BUL supported by F ALB and A UKR), DMZ in the Black Sea with Turkey (Black Sea bounce)."

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 2
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your reasoning: analyze messages/state, decide communication strategy (who to talk to, what to say/ask), and summarize your planned actions for this round.

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: Need to check England's intentions in ENG. Proposal for DMZ seems safe. Germany is quiet, maybe propose BUR DMZ. Memory: Record proposals. Final Plan: Propose ENG DMZ to ENGLAND, propose BUR DMZ to GERMANY, update memory." } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "ENGLAND", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "How about a DMZ in the English Channel this year?" } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "GERMANY", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "Friendly opening? DMZ Burgundy?" } },
  { "tool_name": "update_memory", "arguments": { "key": "S1901M_prop", "value": "Proposed DMZ ENG(E), BUR(G)" } },
  { "tool_name": "finish_negotiation_round", "arguments": {} }
]
```

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.
