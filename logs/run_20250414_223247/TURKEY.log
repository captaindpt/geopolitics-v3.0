You are TURKEY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
You are Turkey. Corner position. Secure the Black Sea and aim for the Balkans (Bul, Gre, Ser, Rum). Often clashes with Austria and Russia.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
The game has just begun.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1901M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_1

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: F ANK, A CON, A SMY
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "BUD"], ["A", "VIE"], ["F", "TRI"]], "ENGLAND": [["F", "EDI"], ["F", "LON"], ["A", "LVP"]], "FRANCE": [["F", "BRE"], ["A", "MAR"], ["A", "PAR"]], "GERMANY": [["F", "KIE"], ["A", "BER"], ["A", "MUN"]], "ITALY": [["F", "NAP"], ["A", "ROM"], ["A", "VEN"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "WAR"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "SEV"], ["F", "STP/SC"]], "TURKEY": [["F", "ANK"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "SMY"]]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  (None)

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 1
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your reasoning: analyze messages/state, decide communication strategy (who to talk to, what to say/ask), and summarize your planned actions for this round.

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: Need to check England's intentions in ENG. Proposal for DMZ seems safe. Germany is quiet, maybe propose BUR DMZ. Memory: Record proposals. Final Plan: Propose ENG DMZ to ENGLAND, propose BUR DMZ to GERMANY, update memory." } },

  { "tool_name": "finish_negotiation_round", "arguments": {} }

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.

Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Thank you for your proposal. I am open to discussing a potential division of the Balkans. However, I need to make sure that my core territories are secure. What specific terms do you have in mind for a potential alliance?
  From ITALY: Thank you for reaching out. While I am open to exploring potential cooperation, my immediate focus might be on other threats. However, I am open to future discussions once the situation becomes clearer.
  From RUSSIA: I agree to a 'Black Sea bounce' where I move F SEV to BLA and you move F ANK to BLA for this round. However, this is a temporary measure and we should discuss future cooperation further.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)

  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: Italy has expressed a desire for a peaceful relationship and open lines of communication. I should acknowledge this and propose a non-aggression pact where Turkey focuses on the Balkans (Greece and Bulgaria) while Italy focuses on the western Mediterranean. Russia has reaffirmed the Black Sea bounce agreement which seems like a good way to avoid early conflict. I should agree to this while also discussing a potential long-term plan such as a division of the Balkans where Turkey gets Bulgaria and Greece while Russia focuses on Romania. Additionally, I need to follow up with Austria on the previous round's proposal where Turkey takes Greece and Bulgaria while Austria takes Serbia and possibly Romania." } },
