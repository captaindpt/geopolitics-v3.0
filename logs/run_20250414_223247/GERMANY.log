== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 1
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your reasoning: analyze messages/state, decide communication strategy (who to talk to, what to say/ask), and summarize your planned actions for this round.

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: Need to check England's intentions in ENG. Proposal for DMZ seems safe. Germany is quiet, maybe propose BUR DMZ. Memory: Record proposals. Final Plan: Propose ENG DMZ to ENGLAND, propose BUR DMZ to GERMANY, update memory." } },

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1901M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello Germany, I appreciate your friendly opening. Given that my main focus is currently on the Balkans, I propose a non-aggression pact between us. Perhaps a DMZ in the Bohemia region could be a good way to ensure that our borders remain peaceful. What are your thoughts?
  From ENGLAND: I agree to a DMZ in the North Sea for this round only. However, any future moves into Belgium or Holland would be part of a strategic plan and not an act of aggression against Germany.
  From FRANCE: I agree to a DMZ in Burgundy for this round. I also suggest that we should both respect a mutual non-aggression pact where you should not move into Belgium either.
  From ITALY: I appreciate your friendly opening. An alliance against France might be a bit premature, but I am open to a non-aggression pact and possibly a future alliance if France becomes a threat. For now, let us keep our options open and maintain a friendly stance.
  From RUSSIA: I agree to a DMZ in Silesia and confirm that I will not move into Berlin or Prussia this round. I propose a non-aggression pact for the first year where you do not move into Warsaw or the Baltic Sea.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello Germany, I hope you are well. I would like to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I am focusing on the south and have no intentions of moving towards your territories. I hope we can maintain a peaceful border.
  From ENGLAND: Let us reaffirm our agreement for a DMZ in the North Sea (NTH) for this round. This will help us both focus on other strategic areas.
  From FRANCE: Hello, I hope our agreement for a DMZ in Burgundy still stands. Additionally, I propose that we both refrain from moving into Belgium this year to avoid any conflicts. What do you think?
  From ITALY: Friendly greetings! I hope our previous round's friendly opening still stands. Let us keep the door open for future alliances if necessary.
  From RUSSIA: Let us reaffirm our non-aggression pact and DMZ in the Baltic Sea. I propose that you keep your fleet out of the Baltic Sea and Sweden. Does that still work for you?

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 2
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your reasoning: analyze messages/state, decide communication strategy (who to talk to, what to say/ask), and summarize your planned actions for this round.

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: Need to check England's intentions in ENG. Proposal for DMZ seems safe. Germany is quiet, maybe propose BUR DMZ. Memory: Record proposals. Final Plan: Propose ENG DMZ to ENGLAND, propose BUR DMZ to GERMANY, update memory." } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "ENGLAND", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "How about a DMZ in the English Channel this year?" } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "GERMANY", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "Friendly opening? DMZ Burgundy?" } },

  { "tool_name": "finish_negotiation_round", "arguments": {} }

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.

Phase: F1901M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: I agree to a non-aggression pact until a later stage in the game. Let us keep our borders secure and focus on other fronts for now.
  From ENGLAND: Hello, I agree that the DMZ in the North Sea should still stand. I am focusing on Norway while Russia is focusing on Sweden. I support your aim for Holland and Belgium. Let us work together to secure our respective areas and avoid any conflicts in the North Sea.
  From FRANCE: I agree that a DMZ in Burgundy (BUR) still makes sense for us. However, I also have strategic interests in Belgium. How about a plan where you aim for Holland while I aim for Belgium? This way, we both expand without conflicting in Burgundy or Belgium.
  From ITALY: Hello, I agree that keeping lines of communication open is important. A non-aggression pact until a later stage in the game sounds good to me.
  From RUSSIA: I reaffirm our non-aggression pact and DMZ in the Baltic Sea. I will focus on the Balkans or Turkey while you aim for Holland and Belgium. Let us avoid any conflicts in the Baltic Sea.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "F MAO - SPA" } },
