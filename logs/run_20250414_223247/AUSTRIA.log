      "thought": "Based on the current game state and the messages received, it seems that both Italy and Russia are proposing a joint attack against Turkey. However, Italy's proposal specifically mentions a 'Lepanto opening,' which involves a coordinated attack on Turkey where Italy moves F NAP to ION and A VEN to APU while requesting that Austria moves F TRI to ADR. This is a well-known opening strategy where Italy and Austria work together against Turkey. On the other hand, Russia also proposes a joint attack on Turkey. However, Turkey has proposed a potential alliance and a division of the Balkans. Given that Austria is surrounded and vulnerable, it makes sense to consider an alliance against Turkey with Italy and Russia. However, a non-aggression pact with Turkey might also be a strategic option to avoid early conflict and secure our core territories. However, a joint attack on Turkey could be a good way to expand and secure our position. Thus, a balanced approach might be to accept Italy's Lepanto opening proposal while also keeping a line of communication open with Turkey to keep them off guard. Additionally, it makes sense to confirm Russia's proposal and make sure that any attack on Turkey is well-coordinated. Another important part of the plan should be to make sure that Italy does not turn against us once Turkey is weakened. Thus, a clear division of the Balkans should be discussed with Italy and Russia. For this round, I need to respond to Germany's friendly opening and propose a non-aggression pact or a DMZ in the Galicia region if necessary. However, the main focus should be on the potential alliance against Turkey."

--- AUSTRIA Context [ORDER_SUBMISSION] (F1901M) ---
======================================================================
You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.

== CURRENT GAME STATE (Focus!) ==
  Your Units: A VIE, A SER, F ALB
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "VIE"], ["A", "SER"], ["F", "ALB"]], "ENGLAND": [["F", "NWG"], ["F", "NTH"], ["A", "YOR"]], "FRANCE": [["F", "MAO"], ["A", "GAS"], ["A", "PIC"]], "GERMANY": [["F", "DEN"], ["A", "PRU"], ["A", "RUH"]], "ITALY": [["A", "ROM"], ["F", "ION"], ["A", "APU"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "WAR"], ["F", "SEV"], ["A", "UKR"], ["F", "BOT"]], "TURKEY": [["F", "ANK"], ["A", "SMY"], ["A", "BUL"]]}
  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "TRI", "VIE"], "ENGLAND": ["EDI", "LON", "LVP"], "FRANCE": ["BRE", "MAR", "PAR"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "KIE", "MUN"], "ITALY": ["NAP", "ROM", "VEN"], "RUSSIA": ["MOS", "SEV", "STP", "WAR"], "TURKEY": ["ANK", "CON", "SMY"]}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1901M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From GERMANY: Hello Austria, I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact. I am focusing on the west and north and have no intentions of moving towards your territories. Let us maintain a peaceful border.
  From ITALY: Thank you for your message. I agree that the Lepanto plan seems like a good strategy. I plan to move F ION to AEG and convoy A APU to Albania if you support that move. Let us make sure our moves are well-coordinated.
  From RUSSIA: I agree with our joint attack plan on Turkey. I will move my fleet from Sevastopol to the Black Sea (F SEV-BLA) so that we can coordinate an attack on Bulgaria or Constantinople. I plan to support your move from Serbia to Bulgaria (A SER-BUL) with my fleet in the Black Sea if needed. Additionally, I will move my army from Ukraine to support any actions in the Balkans.
  From TURKEY: Following up on our previous discussion, I propose that we cooperate in the Balkans where I aim for Greece and Bulgaria while you take Serbia and possibly Romania. This way, we can both expand without clashing. What do you think?

== YOUR PRIVATE NOTES (Memory) ==
{
  "S1901M_prop": "Agreed to non-aggression pact with Germany until a later stage in the game. Agreed to Lepanto opening plan with Italy where F ALB moves to GRE. Agreed to joint attack plan with Russia where A SER moves to BUL supported by F ALB and A UKR. Responded diplomatically to Turkey's proposal."
}

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "F MAO - SPA" } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "A PIC S F MAO - SPA" } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "A MAR H" } },
  { "tool_name": "finish_orders", "arguments": {} }
]
```

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.

Now, provide your JSON response:
