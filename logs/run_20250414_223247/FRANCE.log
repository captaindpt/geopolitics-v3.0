== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 1
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your reasoning: analyze messages/state, decide communication strategy (who to talk to, what to say/ask), and summarize your planned actions for this round.

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json

Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1901M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ENGLAND: Hello, I agree that the DMZ in the English Channel should still stand. I also agree that we should both refrain from moving into Belgium this year to avoid any conflicts. Let us focus on our respective areas of interest.
  From GERMANY: Hello France, I agree that our agreement for a DMZ in Burgundy still stands. However, I need to make a move into Belgium this year to secure a new supply center. I propose that you focus on the Iberian Peninsula or Italy while I aim for Holland and Belgium. Let us avoid any conflicts in Burgundy.
  From ITALY: Hello, I agree that our non-aggression pact for Tuscany and Piedmont still stands. Let us keep our southern borders peaceful.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "F MAO - SPA" } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "A PIC S F MAO - SPA" } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "A MAR H" } },
  { "tool_name": "finish_orders", "arguments": {} }
]
```

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.

Now, provide your JSON response:
