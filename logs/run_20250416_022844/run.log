[2025-04-16 02:29:12.969]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Reasoning: As Austria, my main threats are from Italy and Turkey. I need to secure my core territories (Vie, Bud, Tri) and try to ally with either Italy or Russia against Turkey. A potential alliance with Russia could help us both against Turkey. A non-aggression pact with Italy could help us both focus on other fronts. A friendly message to Germany could help ensure that they do not make any aggressive moves towards me. Plan: Propose an alliance with Russia against Turkey, propose a non-aggression pact with Italy, and send a friendly message to Germany.

[2025-04-16 02:29:38.974]         >> Thought (ENGLAND): As England, my main goal should be to secure the seas around me and aim for Scandinavia while keeping an eye on France and Germany. Given that the game has just begun, it makes sense to make initial contact with France and Germany to establish a friendly opening and possibly secure some non-aggression pacts. Another important power to contact might be Russia, as they could be a potential ally for a joint attack on Germany or a potential threat if they move towards Scandinavia. 

1. **Contact France**: Propose a non-aggression pact where we agree not to move into the English Channel (ENG) this turn. This would allow us to safely move our fleet in London (LON) to the North Sea (NTH) or the English Channel (ENG) if France agrees not to move their fleet in Brest (BRE) into the English Channel.
2. **Contact Germany**: Propose a non-aggression pact where we agree not to make any aggressive moves against each other this turn. This could include a mutual agreement where Germany does not move their fleet in Kiel (KIE) into the North Sea (NTH) and we do not make any moves that could be seen as a threat to Germany.
3. **Contact Russia**: Propose a potential alliance where we could work together against Germany or agree on a division of Scandinavia where England takes Norway and Denmark while Russia takes Sweden. However, this should be approached cautiously as Russia might also be a rival for control of Scandinavia.

Based on this reasoning, I need to send messages to France, Germany, and Russia.
