== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 1
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your reasoning: analyze messages/state, decide communication strategy (who to talk to, what to say/ask), and summarize your planned actions for this round.

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: Need to check England's intentions in ENG. Proposal for DMZ seems safe. Germany is quiet, maybe propose BUR DMZ. Memory: Record proposals. Final Plan: Propose ENG DMZ to ENGLAND, propose BUR DMZ to GERMANY, update memory." } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "ENGLAND", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "How about a DMZ in the English Channel this year?" } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "GERMANY", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "Friendly opening? DMZ Burgundy?" } },
  { "tool_name": "update_memory", "arguments": { "key": "S1901M_prop", "value": "Proposed DMZ ENG(E), BUR(G)" } },
  { "tool_name": "finish_negotiation_round", "arguments": {} }
]
```

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.

Now, provide your JSON response:

      "thought": "As England, my main goal should be to secure the seas around me and aim for Scandinavia while keeping an eye on France and Germany. Given that the game has just begun, it makes sense to make initial contact with France and Germany to establish a friendly opening and possibly secure some non-aggression pacts. Another important power to contact might be Russia, as they could be a potential ally for a joint attack on Germany or a potential threat if they move towards Scandinavia. \n\n1. **Contact France**: Propose a non-aggression pact where we agree not to move into the English Channel (ENG) this turn. This would allow us to safely move our fleet in London (LON) to the North Sea (NTH) or the English Channel (ENG) if France agrees not to move their fleet in Brest (BRE) into the English Channel.\n2. **Contact Germany**: Propose a non-aggression pact where we agree not to make any aggressive moves against each other this turn. This could include a mutual agreement where Germany does not move their fleet in Kiel (KIE) into the North Sea (NTH) and we do not make any moves that could be seen as a threat to Germany.\n3. **Contact Russia**: Propose a potential alliance where we could work together against Germany or agree on a division of Scandinavia where England takes Norway and Denmark while Russia takes Sweden. However, this should be approached cautiously as Russia might also be a rival for control of Scandinavia.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I need to send messages to France, Germany, and Russia."
