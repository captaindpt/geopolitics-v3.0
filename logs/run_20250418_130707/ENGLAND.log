Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.\n
Phase Type: MOVEMENT\nCRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.\nEnsure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.\nREQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.\n
Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):\n  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.\n  - submit_order(order_string: str)\n      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...\n
Common Tools Available:\n  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)\n
