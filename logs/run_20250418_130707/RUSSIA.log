--- Prompt Sent to LLM ---
You are RUSSIA, playing Diplomacy.\n
== CURRENT GAME STATE (Focus!) ==\n  Your Units: A WAR, A MOS, F SEV, F STP/SC\n  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "BUD"], ["A", "VIE"], ["F", "TRI"]], "ENGLAND": [["F", "EDI"], ["F", "LON"], ["A", "LVP"]], "FRANCE": [["F", "BRE"], ["A", "MAR"], ["A", "PAR"]], "GERMANY": [["F", "KIE"], ["A", "BER"], ["A", "MUN"]], "ITALY": [["F", "NAP"], ["A", "ROM"], ["A", "VEN"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "WAR"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "SEV"], ["F", "STP/SC"]], "TURKEY": [["F", "ANK"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "SMY"]]}\n  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "TRI", "VIE"], "ENGLAND": ["EDI", "LON", "LVP"], "FRANCE": ["BRE", "MAR", "PAR"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "KIE", "MUN"], "ITALY": ["NAP", "ROM", "VEN"], "RUSSIA": ["MOS", "SEV", "STP", "WAR"], "TURKEY": ["ANK", "CON", "SMY"]}\n\n== CURRENT SITUATION ==\nPhase: S1901M\nYour Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION\n== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==\nYour response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.\nPay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.\n
Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.\n
Phase Type: MOVEMENT\nCRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.\nEnsure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.\nREQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.\n
Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):\n  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.\n  - submit_order(order_string: str)\n      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...\n
Common Tools Available:\n  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)\n
IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:\n  - finish_orders()\n
Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):\n```json\n[\n  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds.
