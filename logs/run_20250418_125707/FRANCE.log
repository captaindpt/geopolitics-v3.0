            "thought": "Analysis: As France, my main strategic priorities are typically to expand into Belgium (BEL) due to its strategic importance on the northern border and as a potential supply center. Another important goal might be to secure a friendly relationship with England to avoid early conflicts in the English Channel and potentially form an alliance against Germany. Another key area of interest could be Italy, where a peaceful southern border could allow us to focus on expanding elsewhere.\n\nBased on the current units and supply centers, here are some key observations:\n1. Austria has units in BUD, VIE, and TRI, which suggests a potential focus on the Balkans and possibly Italy.\n2. England has units in EDI, LON (fleet), and LVP (army), which means England might be looking to expand towards the Atlantic or possibly support moves into the North Sea and the English Channel.\n3. Germany has units in KIE (fleet), BER (army), and MUN (army), which makes Germany a potential threat to our northern border and a key player in the struggle for Belgium.\n4. Italy has units in NAP (fleet), ROM (army), and VEN (army), which makes Italy a potential threat to our southern border if they decide to move towards Piedmont (PIE) or the Western Mediterranean.\n5. Russia has units in WAR (army), MOS (army), SEV (fleet), and STP/SC (fleet), which makes Russia a major power in the east and a potential threat to Austria and Turkey.\n6. Turkey has units in ANK (fleet), CON (army), and SMY (army), which makes Turkey a major power in the southeast and a potential threat to Russia and Austria.\n\nPlan for this round:\n1. Send a message to England proposing a peaceful division of the English Channel and possibly an alliance against Germany. A common strategy could be for England to focus on the North Sea while France takes Belgium.\n2. Send a message to Italy proposing a peaceful southern border and possibly an alliance against Austria or Germany.\n3. Send a message to Germany to gauge their intentions and possibly propose a temporary truce while focusing on other areas such as England or Russia.\n4. Update memory with any important agreements or intentions discussed in the messages."
