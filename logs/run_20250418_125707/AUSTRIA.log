        "arguments": {
            "thought": "Based on the initial game state, it's the beginning of the game and the first movement phase of 1901. As Austria, my initial units are A BUD, A VIE, and F TRI. Given the geographical position, my main concerns are likely to be Italy (with A VEN close to Trieste) and Russia (with A WAR close to Galicia). However, it's also important to keep an eye on Turkey (with F ANK and A CON close to the Black Sea and Bulgaria).\n\nTo make a strategic plan for negotiation, it makes sense to first try to secure a stable position in the Balkans. A common strategy for Austria is to ally with Italy against Turkey or to ally with Turkey against Italy. Another option is to try a more balanced approach where I aim for a non-aggression pact with Italy while focusing on an alliance with a more distant power such as Germany or Russia against Turkey. Another well-known strategy is the 'Lepanto Opening' which usually involves an alliance between Austria and Italy against Turkey where Austria focuses on the Balkans while Italy sends its fleet to the Ionian Sea to attack Turkey from the west.\n\nBased on this reasoning, a potentially strategic plan could be to make an alliance with Italy against Turkey where I propose that Italy moves its fleet from Naples to the Ionian Sea while I focus on moving my fleet to the Adriatic Sea (which requires no actual movement order for the fleet in Trieste, as it's already there) and potentially move my army from Vienna to either Galicia or Trieste. Another part of the plan could be to make a non-aggression pact with Russia where I assure them that I am focusing on Turkey and would like to avoid any conflict in Galicia.\n\nThus, a plan for this round could be:\n- Send a message to Italy proposing an alliance against Turkey where Italy moves its fleet from Naples to the Ionian Sea (F NAP - ION), while I make a move such as A VIE - TRI (if it makes sense strategically) or A VIE - GAL to put pressure on Turkey from a different angle. Another part of the alliance could be a non-aggression pact where Italy does not move A VEN to Tyrolia or Trieste.\n- Send a message to Russia proposing a non-aggression pact where I make it clear that I am focusing on an attack on Turkey and would like to avoid any conflict in Galicia, so I might move A VIE - GAL or another relevant move, and I need assurance that Russia does not move A WAR - GAL.\n\nBased on this plan, here are some potential orders for my units:\n1. A BUD - SER (assuming an attack on Turkey, we need to secure Serbia)\n2. A VIE - GAL (to put pressure on Russia or support an attack on Turkey if Russia agrees to a non-aggression pact)\n3. F TRI remains in place or moves to the Adriatic Sea if necessary (which would be F TRI - ALB or F TRI H if staying put).\n\n### Plan for round 2 of negotiation:\n1. Message to Italy proposing a joint attack on Turkey and a non-aggression pact for the first year.\n2. Message to Russia proposing a non-aggression pact and making sure they understand that my main focus is on Turkey."
