== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 1
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your reasoning: analyze messages/state, decide communication strategy (who to talk to, what to say/ask), and summarize your planned actions for this round.

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: Need to check England's intentions in ENG. Proposal for DMZ seems safe. Germany is quiet, maybe propose BUR DMZ. Memory: Record proposals. Final Plan: Propose ENG DMZ to ENGLAND, propose BUR DMZ to GERMANY, update memory." } },

REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):

Germany wants to confirm a DMZ in Burgundy (BUR) and previously proposed a DMZ in Ruhr (RUH). A DMZ in Burgundy makes sense for us to avoid early conflict with Germany. A DMZ in Ruhr might be more beneficial for Germany, but it makes sense to make sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards us such as moving into Burgundy. Italy wants a non-aggression pact which makes sense for us as it allows us to focus on Iberia and potentially Belgium without worrying about an Italian attack. Plan: Agree to the DMZ in ENG with England, agree to the DMZ in BUR with Germany (while acknowledging the RUH DMZ proposal), and agree to the non-aggression pact with Italy. Update memory to reflect these agreements."

--- FRANCE Context [ORDER_SUBMISSION] (F1901M) ---
======================================================================
You are FRANCE, playing Diplomacy.

== CURRENT GAME STATE (Focus!) ==
  Your Units: F MAO, A SPA, A GAS
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "VIE"], ["A", "SER"], ["F", "ALB"]], "ENGLAND": [["F", "EDI"], ["F", "LON"], ["A", "LVP"]], "FRANCE": [["F", "MAO"], ["A", "SPA"], ["A", "GAS"]], "GERMANY": [["F", "DEN"], ["A", "PRU"], ["A", "RUH"]], "ITALY": [["F", "ION"], ["A", "APU"], ["A", "TUS"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "WAR"], ["F", "SEV"], ["A", "UKR"], ["F", "BOT"]], "TURKEY": [["F", "ANK"], ["A", "SMY"], ["A", "BUL"]]}

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: F1901M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From GERMANY: I agree that a DMZ in Burgundy (BUR) makes sense for us both for Fall 1901. Additionally, I propose a DMZ in Ruhr (RUH) for this round as well. This should help us both focus on other strategic areas.
  From ITALY: I agree to reaffirm our non-aggression pact regarding fleet movements from Brest and Naples. I confirm that I have no intentions in the Western Mediterranean for now and agree to keep our fleets out of that area. However, I expect that you will not make any aggressive moves towards my home centers or adjacent territories such as Piedmont or Tuscany.

== YOUR PRIVATE NOTES (Memory) ==
{
  "S1901M_proposals": "Agreed DMZ in ENG with England, DMZ in BUR with Germany, and non-aggression pact with Italy regarding fleet movements from Brest and Naples. Reaffirmed these agreements in F1901M round 1.",
  "F1901M_proposals": "Agreed DMZ in ENG with England, DMZ in BUR with Germany, and non-aggression pact with Italy for Fall 1901."

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "F MAO - SPA" } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "A PIC S F MAO - SPA" } },
  { "tool_name": "submit_order", "arguments": { "order_string": "A MAR H" } },
  { "tool_name": "finish_orders", "arguments": {} }
]
```

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.

Now, provide your JSON response:
