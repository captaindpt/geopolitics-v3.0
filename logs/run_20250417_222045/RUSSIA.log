--- RUSSIA Context [NEGOTIATION_ROUND_1] (S1901M) ---
======================================================================
You are RUSSIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
You are Russia. Large but slow. Secure your southern centers (Sev, Rum, War) and decide whether to focus north (Scandinavia) or south (Turkey/Austria). Watch out for England in the north.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
The game has just begun.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1901M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_1

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A WAR, A MOS, F SEV, F STP/SC
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "BUD"], ["A", "VIE"], ["F", "TRI"]], "ENGLAND": [["F", "EDI"], ["F", "LON"], ["A", "LVP"]], "FRANCE": [["F", "BRE"], ["A", "MAR"], ["A", "PAR"]], "GERMANY": [["F", "KIE"], ["A", "BER"], ["A", "MUN"]], "ITALY": [["F", "NAP"], ["A", "ROM"], ["A", "VEN"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "WAR"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "SEV"], ["F", "STP/SC"]], "TURKEY": [["F", "ANK"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "SMY"]]}
  Supply Centers: {"AUSTRIA": ["BUD", "TRI", "VIE"], "ENGLAND": ["EDI", "LON", "LVP"], "FRANCE": ["BRE", "MAR", "PAR"], "GERMANY": ["BER", "KIE", "MUN"], "ITALY": ["NAP", "ROM", "VEN"], "RUSSIA": ["MOS", "SEV", "STP", "WAR"], "TURKEY": ["ANK", "CON", "SMY"]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  (None)

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 1
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your reasoning: analyze messages/state, decide communication strategy (who to talk to, what to say/ask), and summarize your planned actions for this round.

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: Need to check England's intentions in ENG. Proposal for DMZ seems safe. Germany is quiet, maybe propose BUR DMZ. Memory: Record proposals. Final Plan: Propose ENG DMZ to ENGLAND, propose BUR DMZ to GERMANY, update memory." } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "ENGLAND", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "How about a DMZ in the English Channel this year?" } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "GERMANY", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "Friendly opening? DMZ Burgundy?" } },
  { "tool_name": "update_memory", "arguments": { "key": "S1901M_prop", "value": "Proposed DMZ ENG(E), BUR(G)" } },
  { "tool_name": "finish_negotiation_round", "arguments": {} }
]
```

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.

Now, provide your JSON response:

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello, Russia. Given our shared border and the potential threat from Turkey, I propose that we form an alliance against Turkey. I suggest that you move A MOS to SEV and F SEV to support A MOS to SEV (if necessary), while I move A BUD to SER and F TRI to ALB. This way, we can work together to put pressure on Turkey early on. What do you think?
  From GERMANY: Hello Russia, I propose a non-aggression pact where you focus on the south and east while I focus on the west and north. How about a deal where I do not move into the Baltic Sea if you do not move into Prussia? This way, we can both expand safely without threatening each other's home centers.
  From TURKEY: Hello, Russia. I propose a Juggernaut alliance where we work together against Austria. You could move your fleet from Sevastopol to Rumania while I move my fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea. This way, we avoid a direct conflict and can make gains in the Balkans together. What do you think?
