== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  (None)

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 1
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your reasoning: analyze messages/state, decide communication strategy (who to talk to, what to say/ask), and summarize your planned actions for this round.

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: Need to check England's intentions in ENG. Proposal for DMZ seems safe. Germany is quiet, maybe propose BUR DMZ. Memory: Record proposals. Final Plan: Propose ENG DMZ to ENGLAND, propose BUR DMZ to GERMANY, update memory." } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "ENGLAND", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "How about a DMZ in the English Channel this year?" } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "GERMANY", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "Friendly opening? DMZ Burgundy?" } },
  { "tool_name": "update_memory", "arguments": { "key": "S1901M_prop", "value": "Proposed DMZ ENG(E), BUR(G)" } },
  { "tool_name": "finish_negotiation_round", "arguments": {} }
]
```

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.

Given that Turkey is a major threat due to its proximity, it makes sense to first try to make an alliance with Russia. Another potential ally could be Italy, although Italy might also be a rival for control over the Balkans. However, a common enemy in Turkey could make Italy a viable ally. Another important part of my strategy should be to make sure that Germany does not become a threat from the north. However, Germany might be more focused on France and England initially. Thus, my first round of negotiations should focus on reaching out to Russia and Italy to discuss a potential alliance against Turkey. Additionally, I should make sure that Germany is not a threat and perhaps try to make a non-aggression pact with them." } },

  From ITALY: Hello Austria, I propose a 'Lepanto' opening where we jointly attack Turkey. You could move A BUD to SER and F TRI to ALB or ADR while I move F NAP to ION and A ROM to APU. This would put us in a strong position against Turkey. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: How about a joint attack on Turkey where I take Rumania and you take Serbia? This could help us both secure our southern borders.
  From TURKEY: Hello, Austria. I am open to discussing a potential alliance against any mutual threats. However, my main focus is on securing the Black Sea and the Balkans. Let us keep lines of communication open.
