--- GERMANY Context [NEGOTIATION_ROUND_1] (S1901M) ---
======================================================================
You are GERMANY, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
You are Germany. Central position. Aim for Scandinavia, Benelux (Bel, Hol), and potentially Warsaw. Be wary of encirclement by England, France, and Russia.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
The game has just begun.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1901M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_1

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: F KIE, A BER, A MUN
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "BUD"], ["A", "VIE"], ["F", "TRI"]], "ENGLAND": [["F", "EDI"], ["F", "LON"], ["A", "LVP"]], "FRANCE": [["F", "BRE"], ["A", "MAR"], ["A", "PAR"]], "GERMANY": [["F", "KIE"], ["A", "BER"], ["A", "MUN"]], "ITALY": [["F", "NAP"], ["A", "ROM"], ["A", "VEN"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "WAR"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "SEV"], ["F", "STP/SC"]], "TURKEY": [["F", "ANK"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "SMY"]]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  (None)

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 1
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your reasoning: analyze messages/state, decide communication strategy (who to talk to, what to say/ask), and summarize your planned actions for this round.

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: Need to check England's intentions in ENG. Proposal for DMZ seems safe. Germany is quiet, maybe propose BUR DMZ. Memory: Record proposals. Final Plan: Propose ENG DMZ to ENGLAND, propose BUR DMZ to GERMANY, update memory." } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "ENGLAND", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "How about a DMZ in the English Channel this year?" } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "GERMANY", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "Friendly opening? DMZ Burgundy?" } },
  { "tool_name": "update_memory", "arguments": { "key": "S1901M_prop", "value": "Proposed DMZ ENG(E), BUR(G)" } },
  { "tool_name": "finish_negotiation_round", "arguments": {} }
]
```

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.

Now, provide your JSON response:

However, I need to be cautious about potential threats from England, France, and Russia. Given that the game has just begun, it makes sense to try to make some initial diplomatic moves to secure a safe expansion.\n\n1. **England**: It might be beneficial to make a friendly opening towards England to ensure that they do not threaten my home centers. A common opening could be to propose a non-aggression pact where England focuses on the North Sea while I focus on the Baltic Sea. Another option could be to propose a division of Scandinavia where I aim for Denmark and Sweden while England aims for Norway.\n\n2. **France**: Another important neighbor is France. A common opening here could be to propose a DMZ in Burgundy to prevent early conflict. Another option could be to make a friendly gesture such as a non-aggression pact where France focuses on the Mediterranean while I focus on the north and east.\n\n3. **Russia**: Russia has a unit in Warsaw which could potentially threaten Berlin. It might be wise to make a friendly opening here as well, such as proposing a non-aggression pact where Russia focuses on the south and east while I focus on the west and north. Another option could be to make a deal where I do not move into the Baltic Sea if Russia does not move into Prussia.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I need to make initial contact with England, France, and Russia to make friendly openings and propose some initial agreements to secure a safe expansion."

  From AUSTRIA: Hello, Germany. I propose a non-aggression pact where we both focus on our respective regions. I plan to focus on the Balkans and would appreciate if you do not make any aggressive moves towards my territories such as BOH or TYR. What do you think?
  From ENGLAND: Hello Germany, I propose a North Sea Agreement where England takes control of the North Sea while Germany focuses on the Baltic Sea. This way, we can both expand without conflict. What do you think?
  From FRANCE: Hello, Germany. To ensure a friendly opening, how about a DMZ in Burgundy this year? This way, we can both focus on other directions.
