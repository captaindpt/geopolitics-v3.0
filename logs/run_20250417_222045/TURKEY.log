== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 1
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your reasoning: analyze messages/state, decide communication strategy (who to talk to, what to say/ask), and summarize your planned actions for this round.

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: Need to check England's intentions in ENG. Proposal for DMZ seems safe. Germany is quiet, maybe propose BUR DMZ. Memory: Record proposals. Final Plan: Propose ENG DMZ to ENGLAND, propose BUR DMZ to GERMANY, update memory." } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "ENGLAND", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "How about a DMZ in the English Channel this year?" } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "GERMANY", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "Friendly opening? DMZ Burgundy?" } },
  { "tool_name": "update_memory", "arguments": { "key": "S1901M_prop", "value": "Proposed DMZ ENG(E), BUR(G)" } },
  { "tool_name": "finish_negotiation_round", "arguments": {} }
]
```

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.

Now, provide your JSON response:

[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: As Turkey, my main goal is to secure the Black Sea and aim for the Balkans (Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, and Rumania). Given that Russia has a fleet in Sevastopol, it makes sense to try to form a 'Juggernaut' alliance where we work together against Austria. Another part of the plan could be a DMZ in the Black Sea for the first turn until a more solid alliance is formed. Another potential ally could be Austria against Russia if Russia seems uncooperative. Plan: Propose a Juggernaut alliance to Russia where we aim to divide the Balkans and avoid conflict in the Black Sea. Additionally, send a friendly message to Austria to keep lines of communication open and possibly propose a non-aggression pact with Italy." } },

You could move your fleet from Sevastopol to Rumania while I move my fleet from Ankara to the Black Sea. This way, we avoid a direct conflict and can make gains in the Balkans together.
