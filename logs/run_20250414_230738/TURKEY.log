== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  (None)

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 1
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your reasoning: analyze messages/state, decide communication strategy (who to talk to, what to say/ask), and summarize your planned actions for this round.

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: Need to check England's intentions in ENG. Proposal for DMZ seems safe. Germany is quiet, maybe propose BUR DMZ. Memory: Record proposals. Final Plan: Propose ENG DMZ to ENGLAND, propose BUR DMZ to GERMANY, update memory." } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "ENGLAND", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "How about a DMZ in the English Channel this year?" } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "GERMANY", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "Friendly opening? DMZ Burgundy?" } },
  { "tool_name": "update_memory", "arguments": { "key": "S1901M_prop", "value": "Proposed DMZ ENG(E), BUR(G)" } },
  { "tool_name": "finish_negotiation_round", "arguments": {} }
]
```

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.

Now, provide your JSON response:

      "thought": "As Turkey, my overall goal is to secure the Black Sea and aim for the Balkans (Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, and Rumania). Given that I often clash with Austria and Russia, it makes sense to make strategic alliances or at least try to establish a non-aggression pact with one of them initially. However, a common early strategy for Turkey is to make an alliance with Russia against Austria (often called the \"Juggernaut\" alliance) or with Austria against Russia (often called the \"Austro-Turkish\" alliance). Another important part of the opening strategy is to make sure that the fleet in Ankara moves to the Black Sea (F ANK-BLA) so that I can secure that key area early on. Another common move is to move the army in Smyrna to Constantinople (A SMY-CON) so that the army in Constantinople can move elsewhere, such as Bulgaria (A CON-BUL).\n\nBased on the current game state, Russia has a fleet in Sevastopol (F SEV), which could potentially move into the Black Sea. Thus, it makes sense to communicate with Russia first to make sure that there is no immediate conflict in the Black Sea. Another important power to communicate with might be Austria, as we both have an interest in the Balkans. However, a more immediate concern might be Russia's intentions in the Black Sea and the Balkans.\n\nPlan for this round:\n1. Send a message to Russia proposing a non-aggression pact and a possible alliance where we divide the Balkans (e.g., Turkey takes Bulgaria and Greece while Russia takes Rumania and Serbia). Another part of the proposal could be that Russia should not move its fleet from Sevastopol into the Black Sea this turn.\n2. Send a message to Austria to establish a friendly opening and possibly propose a non-aggression pact or an alliance against Russia if Russia seems uncooperative.\n3. Update memory to keep track of the proposals made and any responses received."
