======================================================================
You are AUSTRIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
You are Austria. Surrounded and vulnerable. Secure your core territories (Vie, Bud, Tri) and try to ally with Italy or Russia against Turkey.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
The game has just begun.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1901M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_1

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A BUD, A VIE, F TRI
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "BUD"], ["A", "VIE"], ["F", "TRI"]], "ENGLAND": [["F", "EDI"], ["F", "LON"], ["A", "LVP"]], "FRANCE": [["F", "BRE"], ["A", "MAR"], ["A", "PAR"]], "GERMANY": [["F", "KIE"], ["A", "BER"], ["A", "MUN"]], "ITALY": [["F", "NAP"], ["A", "ROM"], ["A", "VEN"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "WAR"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "SEV"], ["F", "STP/SC"]], "TURKEY": [["F", "ANK"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "SMY"]]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  (None)

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 1
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your reasoning: analyze messages/state, decide communication strategy (who to talk to, what to say/ask), and summarize your planned actions for this round.

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: Need to check England's intentions in ENG. Proposal for DMZ seems safe. Germany is quiet, maybe propose BUR DMZ. Memory: Record proposals. Final Plan: Propose ENG DMZ to ENGLAND, propose BUR DMZ to GERMANY, update memory." } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "ENGLAND", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "How about a DMZ in the English Channel this year?" } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "GERMANY", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "Friendly opening? DMZ Burgundy?" } },
  { "tool_name": "update_memory", "arguments": { "key": "S1901M_prop", "value": "Proposed DMZ ENG(E), BUR(G)" } },
  { "tool_name": "finish_negotiation_round", "arguments": {} }
]
```

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.

Now, provide your JSON response:

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1901M
Your Interaction Step: ORDER_SUBMISSION

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From ITALY: I agree to a non-aggression pact where we both agree not to make any aggressive moves against each other this year. An alliance against Turkey sounds like a good plan. For the Lepanto opening, I propose that I move F NAP to ION and A VEN to APU. A ROM could hold or support any necessary moves. What do you think?
  From RUSSIA: I agree to a non-aggression pact for this year. An alliance against Turkey sounds promising. How about you move to Serbia while I move to Rumania and the Black Sea? This way, we can put pressure on Turkey together.

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR ORDER SUBMISSION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Submit your final, binding orders for this phase.

Phase Type: MOVEMENT
CRITICAL: Base your orders *only* on the 'Current Game State: Your Units' listed ABOVE.
Ensure you issue exactly ONE MOVE, HOLD, or SUPPORT order for EACH of your current units.
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your step-by-step reasoning: explicitly list your current units, evaluate options for each, explain your final decision, and state the planned single order for EACH unit.

Allowed Tools for Order Submission (Movement):
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and final plan for ALL units.
  - submit_order(order_string: str)
      # Format examples: 'A PAR H', 'F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR S A PAR', 'A PIC S F MAO - SPA'...

Common Tools Available:
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: Your response list MUST end with the finish_orders tool call:
  - finish_orders()

Example Final JSON Structure (Movement):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: My units are F MAO, A PIC, A MAR. England might move to ENG, so MAO to SPA is risky but necessary for Iberia. PIC support needed. MAR holds. Final Plan: F MAO -> SPA, A PIC S F MAO -> SPA, A MAR H." } },
