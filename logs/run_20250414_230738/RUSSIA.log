--- RUSSIA Context [NEGOTIATION_ROUND_1] (S1901M) ---
======================================================================
You are RUSSIA, playing Diplomacy.
== OVERALL GOAL ==
You are Russia. Large but slow. Secure your southern centers (Sev, Rum, War) and decide whether to focus north (Scandinavia) or south (Turkey/Austria). Watch out for England in the north.

== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
The game has just begun.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1901M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_1

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: A WAR, A MOS, F SEV, F STP/SC
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "BUD"], ["A", "VIE"], ["F", "TRI"]], "ENGLAND": [["F", "EDI"], ["F", "LON"], ["A", "LVP"]], "FRANCE": [["F", "BRE"], ["A", "MAR"], ["A", "PAR"]], "GERMANY": [["F", "KIE"], ["A", "BER"], ["A", "MUN"]], "ITALY": [["F", "NAP"], ["A", "ROM"], ["A", "VEN"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "WAR"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "SEV"], ["F", "STP/SC"]], "TURKEY": [["F", "ANK"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "SMY"]]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  (None)

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 1
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your reasoning: analyze messages/state, decide communication strategy (who to talk to, what to say/ask), and summarize your planned actions for this round.

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: Need to check England's intentions in ENG. Proposal for DMZ seems safe. Germany is quiet, maybe propose BUR DMZ. Memory: Record proposals. Final Plan: Propose ENG DMZ to ENGLAND, propose BUR DMZ to GERMANY, update memory." } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "ENGLAND", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "How about a DMZ in the English Channel this year?" } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "GERMANY", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "Friendly opening? DMZ Burgundy?" } },
  { "tool_name": "update_memory", "arguments": { "key": "S1901M_prop", "value": "Proposed DMZ ENG(E), BUR(G)" } },
  { "tool_name": "finish_negotiation_round", "arguments": {} }
]
```

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.

Now, provide your JSON response:

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  From AUSTRIA: Hello Russia, I propose a non-aggression pact where we both agree not to make any aggressive moves against each other this year. Additionally, I suggest that we consider an alliance against Turkey. What do you think?
  From ENGLAND: Hello Russia, to avoid conflict in Scandinavia, how about a division where I aim for Norway and Denmark while you aim for Sweden and Finland?
  From GERMANY: Hello, Russia. To ensure a peaceful border, I propose a DMZ in Silesia. I am open to discussing a division of influence where we both focus on our other borders initially. However, I might be interested in Warsaw in the future if you are open to a southern or eastern focus. What do you think?
  From TURKEY: Hello, Russia. As Turkey, I propose a non-aggression pact where we aim to avoid conflict in the Black Sea. I suggest that you keep your fleet in Sevastopol where it is, and I will keep my fleet in Ankara for now. Additionally, I propose that we divide the Balkans such that I aim for Bulgaria and Greece while you aim for Rumania and Serbia. What do you think about this plan?
