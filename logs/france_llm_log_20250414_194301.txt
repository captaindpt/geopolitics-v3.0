Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Optional: Log reasoning.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient is POWER name.
      # CRITICAL: The 'recipient' MUST be one of the 7 major powers: ['AUSTRIA', 'ENGLAND', 'FRANCE', 'GERMANY', 'ITALY', 'RUSSIA', 'TURKEY'].
      # DO NOT use any other names or abbreviations like 'Spa' or 'Por'.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
