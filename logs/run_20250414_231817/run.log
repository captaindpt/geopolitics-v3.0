[2025-04-14 23:18:38.793]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): As Austria, my main goal is to secure my core territories (Vie, Bud, Tri) and try to ally with either Italy or Russia against Turkey. Given that Turkey is a significant threat due to its proximity, it makes sense to reach out to Russia first for a potential alliance against Turkey. Another potential ally could be Italy, although Italy might also be a rival for control over the Balkans. However, a non-aggression pact could be beneficial initially. Another important part of my strategy should be to make sure that Germany does not pose a threat from the north. However, Germany seems to be more focused on France and England initially. Thus, my main focus should be on securing an alliance with Russia and possibly a non-aggression pact with Italy. I need to make sure that my units are well-positioned to defend against any potential Turkish aggression while also making moves that could help us expand into the Balkans together with Russia.

I need to make sure that my moves do not provoke an early conflict with France or Germany. Thus, I should propose a DMZ in the English Channel with France and a DMZ in the North Sea with Germany. Additionally, I should reach out to Russia to make a deal about Scandinavia where I aim to secure Norway. Plan: Propose a DMZ in the English Channel to France, a DMZ in the North Sea to Germany, and a division of Scandinavia with Russia where I aim for Norway.

[2025-04-14 23:19:37.207]         >> Thought (FRANCE): Reasoning: As France, my main goals are to expand into Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and potentially into Belgium and Burgundy. To make a safe opening, I need to negotiate with England about the English Channel (ENG) and with Germany about Burgundy (BUR). I should propose a DMZ in the English Channel to England to avoid early conflict and a DMZ in Burgundy to Germany to secure my eastern border. I should also make a note of these proposals in my memory.

To achieve this, I need to make friendly openings with England and France while keeping an eye on Russia. Plan: Propose a DMZ in the North Sea (NTH) to England to avoid early conflict and suggest a potential alliance where England focuses on France while I focus on Russia. Propose a DMZ in Burgundy (BUR) to France to avoid early conflict and suggest a potential alliance where France focuses on England while I focus on Russia. Propose a DMZ in Silesia (SIL) and Galicia (GAL) to Russia to avoid early conflict and suggest a potential alliance where Russia focuses on Austria or Turkey while I focus on France or England.

I need to make a friendly gesture towards France to avoid early conflict. Plan: Propose a joint attack on Turkey with Austria where I move F NAP - ION and A VEN - APU (or A ROM - APU and A VEN holds or moves elsewhere). Propose a DMZ in Piedmont (PIE) with France to ensure that France does not move into that region. Update memory with the main negotiation points.

[2025-04-14 23:21:59.887]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: Need to secure southern centers (Sev, Rum, War) and decide on a north or south focus. Propose a DMZ in the Black Sea to Turkey to secure the southern front while focusing on capturing Sweden in the north. Propose a joint attack on Turkey with Austria where Austria moves into Serbia and Russia moves into Rumania. Propose a non-aggression pact with Germany where Germany focuses on the west while Russia focuses on the south. Propose a non-aggression pact with England where England focuses on the west while Russia focuses on the south or a mutual agreement on Scandinavia where Russia takes Sweden while England takes Norway.

[2025-04-14 23:22:44.030]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: As Turkey, my main goal is to secure the Black Sea and aim for the Balkans (Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, and Rumania). I need to negotiate with Russia to ensure that we do not clash in the Black Sea. A possible plan could be to propose that Russia moves their fleet in Sevastopol (F SEV) to Rumania (RUM) while I move my fleet in Ankara (F ANK) to the Black Sea (BLA). Another part of the plan could be to negotiate with Austria to divide the Balkans such that I aim for Bulgaria and Greece while Austria aims for Serbia and Rumania. However, Rumania is a part of my goal, so I need to be cautious here. Another option might be to propose a joint attack against Russia with Austria. However, a more common and safer initial plan might be to make a non-aggression pact with Russia and try to make a joint plan against Austria.

[2025-04-14 23:23:14.891]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Based on the current game state and the messages received, it seems that both Italy and Russia are proposing a joint attack on Turkey. However, Turkey has proposed a non-aggression pact and a division of the Balkans where they aim for Bulgaria and Greece while I aim for Serbia and Rumania. However, Turkey also mentioned a potential joint plan against Russia. Given that Turkey is a direct neighbor and a potential threat, it makes sense to consider an alliance with Italy and Russia against Turkey. However, a non-aggression pact with Turkey could also be a strategic move to secure my southern border while focusing on another front. However, a joint attack on Turkey seems like a more aggressive and potentially rewarding strategy. However, I need to make a decision and communicate it clearly to the relevant powers. I need to make a decision on which alliance seems most beneficial. An alliance with Italy and Russia against Turkey seems like a strong plan because it allows us to contain a common threat and expand our territories. However, I need to make sure that Italy and Russia are also on board with this plan and that there is a clear division of territories post-attack. Another important point is that I need to make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards my territories such as Trieste or Albania. Thus, I need to make a proposal to Italy and Russia for a coordinated attack on Turkey while also making a more cautious response to Turkey to keep them at bay until I make a final decision. Based on this reasoning, I should send a message to Italy and Russia to confirm their proposals and make a plan for a joint attack on Turkey. I should also respond to Turkey in a way that keeps them neutral until I make a final decision.

[2025-04-14 23:26:43.582]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: Russia has proposed a DMZ in the Black Sea where Turkey keeps F ANK in Ankara and Russia keeps F SEV in Sevastopol. While a DMZ might prevent early conflict, it might also limit Turkey's expansion into the Black Sea. However, it could be a good way to avoid an early conflict with Russia. Another part of the private notes mentions a previous proposal where Russia moves F SEV to RUM and Turkey moves F ANK to BLA, which seems a bit risky. Another part of the private notes mentions a non-aggression pact with Austria where Turkey aims for Bulgaria and Greece while Austria aims for Serbia and Rumania. Plan: Agree to Russia's DMZ proposal for the first year while suggesting a long-term plan where Turkey aims for Bulgaria and Greece. Confirm the non-aggression pact with Austria where Turkey aims for Bulgaria and Greece while Austria aims for Serbia and Rumania.

[2025-04-14 23:27:29.543]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Reasoning: Based on the agreements with Italy and Russia for a joint attack on Turkey, the plan should be as follows: A BUD should move to SER to capture Serbia and put pressure on Turkey. A VIE should move to GAL to make a strategic move towards the Russian border and support future moves into Rumania or Galicia. F TRI should move to ALB to support the joint attack on Turkey and potentially move towards Greece. Final Plan: A BUD - SER, A VIE - GAL, F TRI - ALB.

[2025-04-14 23:28:03.225]         >> Thought (ENGLAND): Reasoning: My units are F EDI, F LON, A LVP. Based on the DMZ agreements with France and Germany, F LON should hold (F LON H) because both the English Channel (ENG) and the North Sea (NTH) are part of DMZ agreements. F EDI should move to the Norwegian Sea (F EDI - NWG) to prepare for a move into Norway in the fall. A LVP should move to Yorkshire (A LVP - YOR) to be in a position to support a future move into Belgium or protect against a potential German move into the North Sea.

[2025-04-14 23:29:37.785]         >> Thought (FRANCE): Reasoning: My units are F BRE, A MAR, and A PAR. Given the DMZ agreement with England in the English Channel (ENG), moving F BRE to MAO seems like a safe and strategic move to prepare for a move into Spain. A MAR should move to SPA to secure the supply center there. A PAR should move to GAS to support A MAR's move to SPA if needed. Final Plan: F BRE - MAO, A MAR - SPA, A PAR - GAS.

Based on the messages, England wants a DMZ in the North Sea until fall moves, France wants a DMZ in Burgundy and no aggressive moves towards Belgium or Holland, and Russia wants a non-aggression pact for the central region and a DMZ in Silesia and Galicia. Final Plan: F KIE -> DEN to secure Denmark, A BER -> PRU to secure Prussia while not directly threatening Russia, A MUN -> RUH to position us closer to Belgium and Holland while not violating the Burgundy DMZ.

Based on the plan agreed with Austria to attack Turkey, I should move F NAP to ION to position for an attack on Turkey. Austria suggests that either A VEN or A ROM should move to APU. Since A VEN is closer to APU, it makes sense to move A VEN to APU and hold A ROM in Rome for defense and flexibility. Final Plan: F NAP - ION, A VEN - APU, A ROM H.

Austria suggests A WAR - GAL and A MOS - SEV (with F SEV supporting A MOS - SEV if necessary). However, Germany wants a DMZ in Silesia and Galicia. England agrees that I should aim for Sweden while they aim for Norway. Turkey agrees to a DMZ in the Black Sea where I keep F SEV in Sevastopol. Final Plan: A WAR - GAL (following Austria's suggestion), A MOS - UKR (for a central position), F SEV H (to honor the DMZ agreement with Turkey), F STP/SC - GOB (to make a move to Sweden next turn).

A CON should move to Bulgaria (A CON - BUL) as part of the plan agreed upon with Austria where Turkey aims for Bulgaria and Greece. A SMY should move to Greece (A SMY - GRE) as part of the same plan where Turkey aims for Bulgaria and Greece. Final Plan: F ANK H, A CON - BUL, A SMY - GRE.

For Russia, reaffirm the non-aggression pact where Germany focuses on the west and Russia focuses on the south. However, a DMZ in Silesia might be a bit too restrictive for Germany.

Reaffirm DMZ in NTH with Germany and discuss future plans for Scandinavia while making sure Germany does not feel threatened. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Russia and discuss future plans against Germany.

Russia wants to reaffirm the DMZ in the Black Sea and discuss a joint plan against Austria. Austria has already captured Bulgaria, which was part of our initial plan where we aimed for Bulgaria and Greece. Plan: Propose a non-aggression pact with Italy where Turkey aims for Bulgaria and Greece while Italy focuses on other areas such as Tunis or the Western Mediterranean. Reaffirm the DMZ in the Black Sea with Russia and discuss a joint plan against Austria where Turkey aims to recapture Bulgaria and possibly move into Serbia and Rumania. Follow up with Austria to address the issue of them capturing Bulgaria and try to find a new agreement where Turkey aims for Serbia and Rumania while Austria keeps Bulgaria for now.

The plan previously noted was to build a fleet in Trieste (F TRI B) to support naval operations against Turkey. Italy agrees that a fleet in Trieste could be a good move.

Since there is one more supply center than units, England should build one unit. The only vacant home supply center is Edinburgh (EDI). A fleet build in Edinburgh (F EDI B) seems strategically useful for naval operations and supporting the fleet in Norway (F NWY).

[2025-04-15 00:03:37.019]         >> Thought (FRANCE): Reasoning: France has two builds available. Home supply centers BRE, MAR, and PAR are all vacant. A fleet in Brest (F BRE B) seems important for naval power projection against England or for operations in the Mid-Atlantic. An army in Paris (A PAR B) could be used for central defense and offensive operations against Germany or for supporting operations in the north or east. Final Plan: Build a fleet in Brest (F BRE B) and an army in Paris (A PAR B).

[2025-04-15 00:05:12.980]         >> Thought (GERMANY): Reasoning: Germany has two builds available because it has 5 supply centers (BER, KIE, MUN, BEL, DEN) and currently has 3 units (F DEN, A BER, A BEL). The unoccupied home supply centers are KIE and MUN. A fleet in KIE could be useful for naval operations in the Baltic Sea or Helgoland Bight, while an army in MUN could be useful for operations in central Europe or to support actions in the west against France or in the south against Austria. Thus, the plan is to build a fleet in KIE (F KIE B) and an army in MUN (A MUN B).

Valid home supply centers for a new unit are MOS, STP, and WAR. An army in MOS seems like a solid choice for a central position that allows for a push towards either the south (against Turkey or Austria) or the west (against Germany if needed). Final Plan: Build an army in Moscow (A MOS B).

The only vacant home supply center is CON. Given the need for a stronger naval presence in the Black Sea and Aegean Sea, it makes sense to build a fleet in Constantinople.

For Italy, propose that Italy keeps F AEG where it is or moves it to ION if it makes sense for a joint attack on Turkey. For Russia, propose that Russia moves A GAL to RUM and F SEV supports any attack on Turkey from the Black Sea. Assure both allies that Austria will not make any aggressive moves towards them.

[2025-04-15 00:14:24.953]         >> Thought (ITALY): Reasoning: The main goal should be to continue the joint attack on Turkey with Austria. However, it is important to make sure that France does not make any aggressive moves towards Italy. Additionally, it might be beneficial to check in with Russia for a coordinated attack on Turkey. A temporary truce with Turkey might be a strategic option if it allows us to secure Tunis without conflict. Plan: Propose a joint attack plan with Austria (F AEG supports F ALB to GRE, A NAP - ION, A APU - TUN if feasible). Reaffirm non-aggression pact with France. Contact Russia for a potential three-way alliance against Turkey. Respond to Turkey's truce proposal cautiously.

[2025-04-15 00:17:27.938]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Reasoning: Italy's proposal makes sense for a joint attack on Turkey where F AEG supports F ALB to move to GRE. However, A NAP cannot move to ION because it is an army. A NAP could move to TUN if feasible. Russia's proposal makes sense where A UKR moves to RUM and F SEV moves to BLA. A BUL should support an attack on CON or GRE. Turkey's new proposal seems risky; it might be a trap. Plan: Reaffirm joint attack plans with Italy and Russia. Politely decline Turkey's new proposal and keep a strong defensive position against Turkey.

[2025-04-15 00:22:30.334]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: Italy has acknowledged the truce where Italy focuses on Tunis while Turkey focuses on Bulgaria and Greece. However, Austria has already captured Bulgaria which was part of Turkey's initial plan. Russia reaffirms the non-aggression pact and DMZ in the Black Sea and asks about Turkey's plans. Plan: Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy and make it clear that Turkey's main focus is on Bulgaria and Greece. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in the Black Sea with Russia and propose a joint plan against Austria where Turkey aims to recapture Bulgaria and possibly move into Serbia and Rumania. Address the issue of Austria capturing Bulgaria and propose a new agreement where Turkey aims for Serbia and Rumania while Austria keeps Bulgaria for now.

Based on the DMZ agreements and non-aggression pacts, a strategic plan could be: A SPA should move to GAS to make a stronger presence in Gascony and prepare for a potential move into Burgundy if needed. A GAS should hold to make sure that the supply center is defended. F POR should move to MAO to make a stronger presence in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean and support a potential future move into the English Channel or to support a move into Spain if needed. F BRE should also move to MAO to make a strong presence in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean and support a potential future move into the English Channel or to support a move into Spain if needed. A PAR should hold in Paris to make sure that the supply center is defended. Final Plan: A SPA - GAS, A GAS H, F POR - MAO, F BRE - MAO, A PAR H.

Based on the DMZ agreements with England (NTH and SKA), France (BUR), and Russia (BAL and Galicia), the plan is as follows: F DEN should hold (F DEN H) to maintain a defensive position. A BER should hold (A BER H) to maintain a central defensive position. A BEL should move to Holland (A BEL - HOL) to secure another supply center while avoiding a move to Picardy (PIC) as requested by France. F KIE should hold (F KIE H) to maintain a defensive position. A MUN should hold (A MUN H) to maintain a central defensive position and avoid a move to Burgundy (BUR) as requested by France.

A NAP should move to TUN to potentially capture a new supply center. A APU should hold its position to secure APU. Final Plan: F AEG S F ALB - GRE, A APU H, A NAP - TUN.

Based on the messages, the main plan seems to be a joint attack on Turkey with Austria. Thus, F SEV should move to BLA to put pressure on Turkey's coastal provinces such as CON and BUL. A UKR should move to RUM with support from A GAL. F SWE should hold in SWE as agreed with England. A MOS should move to UKR to fill the gap left by A UKR moving to RUM. Final Plan: F SEV - BLA, A UKR - RUM, A GAL S A UKR - RUM, F SWE H, A MOS - UKR.

To recapture Bulgaria from Austria, A SMY should move to Bulgaria (A SMY - BUL) with support from A GRE (A GRE S A SMY - BUL) and F CON (F CON S A SMY - BUL). Final Plan: F ANK H, A SMY - BUL, A GRE S A SMY - BUL, F CON S A SMY - BUL.

Russia suggests that A BUL and F GRE should support A RUM to CON. Turkey proposes a new agreement where Austria keeps Bulgaria while Turkey aims for Serbia and Rumania. Plan: Reaffirm joint attack plans with Italy and Russia. For Italy, propose that F AEG supports A BUL to attack CON. For Russia, agree that A BUL and F GRE should support A RUM to CON. Politely decline Turkey's new proposal and reaffirm that Austria needs to keep Bulgaria and Greece secure.

[2025-04-15 01:11:10.515]         >> Thought (ENGLAND): Reasoning: France proposes a joint action against Germany where England supports a French move into Belgium from BUR or directly attacks Belgium from NTH. Germany wants to reaffirm DMZ agreements for NTH and BAL. Russia reaffirms the non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia where Norway is for England and Sweden is for Russia. Plan: To France, acknowledge the DMZ in ENG and suggest a joint action where France supports England's move into Belgium from NTH. To Germany, reaffirm DMZ in NTH and BAL but express concern about Germany's unit in Holland. To Russia, reaffirm the non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia, and suggest a joint action against Germany such as England moving into Denmark while Russia secures Sweden.

[2025-04-15 01:11:54.906]         >> Thought (FRANCE): Reasoning: England proposes a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Belgium (BEL) or Holland (HOL). A joint action on Belgium seems beneficial for us as it is a German supply center. Germany wants to reaffirm the DMZ in Burgundy (BUR), which seems beneficial for maintaining a peaceful border. Italy wants to reaffirm the non-aggression pact in the Western Mediterranean. Plan: Propose a joint action with England to attack Belgium (BEL) while making sure that England does not make any moves that could threaten us in the English Channel (ENG) or the North Sea (NTH). Reaffirm the DMZ in Burgundy (BUR) with Germany. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Italy.

[2025-04-15 01:12:57.336]         >> Thought (GERMANY): Reasoning: England proposes a joint action against Russia due to the Russian fleet in Sweden (F SWE). A joint action such as supporting England's F SKA to move into Sweden could be beneficial. France is concerned about Germany's unit in Holland (A HOL) making a move towards Belgium (BEL). Reaffirm the DMZ in BUR and make a non-committal statement about Belgium. Italy wants to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and explore cooperation against France or Austria. Russia wants to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and DMZ in the Baltic Sea. Plan: Propose a joint action against Russia to England, reaffirm DMZ in BUR to France, reaffirm non-aggression pact and explore cooperation against France with Italy, and reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea to Russia.

[2025-04-15 01:14:27.334]         >> Thought (ITALY): Reasoning: Austria is a key ally in the joint attack on Turkey. The plan to support F GRE to move to AEG makes sense strategically. France should be kept neutral with a reaffirmed non-aggression pact. Germany's proposal for cooperation against France should be acknowledged but our main focus should be on Turkey. Russia's proposal for a joint attack on Turkey should be coordinated carefully. Turkey's proposal for an alliance against Austria should be politely declined while keeping communication open. Plan: Reaffirm joint attack plan with Austria (F AEG supports F GRE to AEG and supports an attack on CON), reaffirm non-aggression pact with France, acknowledge Germany's proposal but focus on Turkey, coordinate with Russia for a joint attack on Turkey, and decline Turkey's proposal for an alliance against Austria.

Reaffirm non-aggression pact with England and express interest in a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Denmark. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ agreements with Germany.

Russia agrees that their F BLA will support an attack on CON from the sea and their A UKR will move to RUM to support an attack on ANK or CON from the land. Thus, the plan should be: A VIE should hold in VIE for now. A BUL should move to CON supported by F BLA from Russia and F AEG from Italy. F TRI should hold in TRI.

Reaffirm DMZ in BUR with Germany and make sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards France. Reaffirm non-aggression pact in the Western Mediterranean with Italy and make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards us.

For Germany, reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia. For Italy, reaffirm joint attack on Turkey and discuss next moves such as supporting F AEG to move towards CON or Smyrna. For Turkey, keep them in a false sense of security while planning for an attack. Plan to build a new unit in St. Petersburg (STP), likely a fleet (F STP) to secure the northern front against England.

Italy and Russia are still on board for a joint attack on Turkey. Italy suggests that F GRE should support F AEG to attack CON or SMY. Russia suggests that A BUL should move towards SER or CON and asks about our build plans. Turkey wants us to give up Greece or make a new division where they aim for Greece and possibly Bulgaria. Plan: Agree to a non-aggression pact with Germany. For Italy, suggest that F GRE should move to AEG and attack CON while F AEG supports. For Russia, suggest that A BUL should support an attack on CON and that we plan to build a fleet in Trieste (F TRI).

Russia congratulates us on capturing Holland and suggests continuing the non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia. Plan: Acknowledge France's proposal and express interest in a coordinated attack on Belgium. Reaffirm DMZ agreements with Germany and be cautious about a joint action against Russia's F SWE.

Address England's concern about a unit in Holland (which seems to be a misunderstanding). Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy and express interest in cooperating against France if an opportunity arises.

[2025-04-15 01:41:38.247]         >> Thought (ITALY): Reasoning: The main goal should be to continue the joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Russia until a significant gain such as capturing Constantinople is made. However, it is important to make sure that once CON is captured, Italy should hold it to balance power. Reaffirm non-aggression pacts with France and Germany while keeping open the possibility of future cooperation against Austria if it becomes too powerful. Plan: Agree to support Austria's plan for a joint attack on CON where F AEG supports F GRE to move to AEG. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with France and express willingness to discuss future cooperation against Austria if necessary. Acknowledge Germany's interest in cooperating against France and suggest a future joint action once the situation with Turkey is resolved. Agree with Russia to continue the joint attack on Turkey.

[2025-04-15 01:42:27.507]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: Austria is a strong ally against Turkey and should be supported until Turkey is significantly weakened. England should be kept as a non-aggression partner and a potential ally against Germany. France should be kept neutral or as a potential ally against Germany. Germany should be kept at bay with a non-aggression pact until a joint action with England makes us reconsider. Italy should be supported in the joint action against Turkey. Turkey should be kept in a false sense of security until a decisive move is made against them. Plan: Reaffirm joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy, reaffirm non-aggression pact and joint action against Germany with England, reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Germany, keep Turkey in a false sense of security.

[2025-04-15 01:43:30.792]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: Austria has captured Greece from Turkey which makes the previous agreements less favorable for Turkey. Russia seems open to a joint plan against Austria. Italy wants a significant concession such as withdrawing from Smyrna or Constantinople which is not in Turkey's best interest. Germany seeks a non-aggression pact. Plan: Propose a joint plan against Austria with Russia where Turkey aims to recapture Greece and possibly move into Bulgaria while Russia keeps Rumania. Express dissatisfaction with Austria and propose a new agreement where Austria should give up Greece. Reiterate non-aggression pact with Italy but make it clear that withdrawing from Smyrna or Constantinople is not viable. Acknowledge Germany's message and express a willingness to maintain a peaceful border.

[2025-04-15 01:46:16.986]         >> Thought (ENGLAND): Reasoning: England has one build available because it controls five supply centers (EDI, LON, LVP, NWY, HOL) and currently has four units (F EDI, F SKA, F HOL, A LON). The only unoccupied home supply center is Liverpool (LVP). A fleet seems strategically useful for naval operations such as supporting moves in the North Sea or the English Channel. Thus, the plan is to build a fleet in Liverpool (LVP).

The home supply centers that are currently unoccupied are MOS, SEV, STP, and WAR. Given the joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy, a build in SEV could directly support the southern front. However, a build in MOS provides a central and flexible position that can be used to support actions against Germany or Austria if needed. Thus, a strategic choice could be to build an army in Moscow (A MOS B).

[2025-04-15 01:50:27.300]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Reasoning: Need to reaffirm alliances with Italy and Russia against Turkey. Propose a joint attack on Turkey where Italy supports F GRE to move to AEG and F AEG should support an attack on CON. Russia should make a move on CON from the Black Sea and possibly make a move on SER. Reaffirm non-aggression pacts where Austria does not move into VEN or ADR and Italy does not move into TRI or ALB. Assure Russia that Austria will not make any aggressive moves towards Rumania. Politely decline any new proposals from Turkey and reaffirm that Austria needs to keep Bulgaria and Greece secure.

[2025-04-15 01:51:50.572]         >> Thought (FRANCE): Reasoning: Need to reaffirm DMZ in ENG with England and discuss a potential joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Belgium (BEL). Reaffirm DMZ in BUR with Germany and make sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards France. Reaffirm non-aggression pact in the Western Mediterranean with Italy and make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards us. Reaffirm any previous discussions with Russia about a potential alliance against Germany or a neutral stance.

[2025-04-15 01:52:26.972]         >> Thought (GERMANY): Reasoning: Germany needs to maintain a stable western front while focusing on potential threats from Russia in the north. Reaffirming DMZ in NTH with England and BUR with France is crucial. A joint action against Russia's fleet in Sweden could be beneficial. Reaffirming non-aggression pacts with Russia, Italy, and initiating one with Austria and Turkey could help in isolating Russia. Plan: Propose DMZ in NTH to England, DMZ in BUR to France, joint action against Russia's F SWE with England, reaffirm non-aggression pact with Russia, Italy, and initiate one with Austria and Turkey.

[2025-04-15 01:52:54.157]         >> Thought (ITALY): Reasoning: The main goal is to continue the joint attack on Turkey with Austria while maintaining non-aggression pacts with France and Germany. It's important to keep the alliance with Austria strong until Turkey is significantly weakened. Additionally, it might be worth exploring a potential future alliance with Turkey against Austria once Turkey is sufficiently weakened. Plan: Reaffirm the alliance with Austria against Turkey, reaffirm non-aggression pacts with France and Germany, coordinate with Russia for joint actions against Turkey, and cautiously handle any new proposals from Turkey.

Reaffirm non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia with England while expressing concern about the fleet in Skagerrak. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Germany. Keep Turkey in a false sense of security. Final Plan: Propose coordinated attack on Turkey to Austria and Italy, seek reassurance from England about Skagerrak fleet, reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany, and keep Turkey in a false sense of security.

[2025-04-15 01:54:03.152]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: Austria captured Greece from us in F1902M, which makes them a significant threat. Russia captured Rumania and has a fleet in the Black Sea, making them a potential threat as well. However, Russia seems to be a more powerful player currently. Italy could be a potential ally against Austria. Plan: Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in the Black Sea with Russia while proposing a joint plan against Austria where Turkey aims to recapture Greece and possibly move into Bulgaria. Propose a new agreement with Austria where they should give up Greece or make a new division of the Balkans where Turkey aims for Greece and possibly Bulgaria. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and propose a potential alliance against Austria with Italy where Turkey aims to recapture Greece and possibly move into Bulgaria.

Germany proposes a DMZ in NTH and a joint action against Russia's F SWE.

[2025-04-15 01:58:34.349]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: Austria wants a joint attack on Turkey where F BLA should support an attack on CON or make a move on ANK and make a move on SER. England wants a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on DEN where F SKA could move to DEN supported by F SWE. France wants a potential alliance against Germany or Austria. Germany wants to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and DMZ in the Baltic Sea and Galicia. Italy wants to coordinate actions against Turkey where F AEG can support joint attacks on CON or SMY. Turkey wants a new agreement where Turkey aims for BUL and GRE while Russia focuses on other areas such as Austria or Italy. Plan: Reaffirm joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy, agree to a joint action against Germany with England, reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ with Germany, keep Turkey in a false sense of security.

[2025-04-15 01:59:29.265]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: Austria has captured Bulgaria and Greece, which conflicts with Turkey's goal of securing the Balkans. Russia sees Austria as a growing threat and wants to continue the non-aggression pact. Germany proposes a non-aggression pact and a possible joint action against Russia. Italy is open to new proposals once the situation stabilizes. Plan: Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Black Sea with Russia and propose a joint plan against Austria where Turkey aims to recapture Greece and possibly move into Bulgaria. Propose a new agreement with Austria where Turkey aims for Greece and possibly Bulgaria. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy and propose a potential alliance against Austria. Acknowledge Germany's message and express willingness to maintain a peaceful border and potentially ally against a common enemy such as Russia or Austria.

Based on the messages from Italy and Russia, the plan should be to continue the joint attack on Turkey. Italy agrees to support F GRE - AEG (F AEG supports F GRE - AEG) and support an attack on CON (F AEG supports A BUL - CON). Russia plans to move F BLA to support an attack on CON or make a move on ANK. A RUM could make a move on BUL supported by A UKR, which seems a bit suspicious. Thus, A BUL should make a move to CON supported by F AEG. F GRE should move to AEG supported by F AEG. A BUD should move to SER supported by A VIE. F TRI should hold. Final Plan: A VIE S A BUD - SER, A BUL - CON, F TRI H, F GRE - AEG, A BUD - SER.

Russia wants a joint action against Germany where F SKA moves to DEN supported by F SWE. To secure the North Sea, F EDI should move to NTH. F SKA should move to DEN supported by F SWE (as per Russia's proposal). F HOL should hold in HOL to defend against potential German attacks. A LON should support France's A PAR to BEL (as per France's proposal). F LVP should hold in LVP for now.

Based on the non-aggression pact with Russia, F DEN should move to BAL for a defensive position against Russia's F SWE. A BER should move to KIE to protect against a potential English move into KIE. F HEL should move to HOL to secure the supply center if England has a fleet there (F HOL). A RUH should also move to HOL to support F HEL in securing Holland. A BEL should hold in Belgium until France makes its intentions clear. Final Plan: F DEN - BAL, A BER - KIE, F HEL - HOL, A RUH - HOL, A BEL H.

Based on the messages, Austria proposes that F AEG supports F GRE to move to AEG so that it can be in a position to attack CON in the next round. Another option is to support A BUL to attack CON, but supporting F GRE to move to AEG seems more strategic. For A VEN and A ROM, holding position seems like a safe option given the non-aggression pact with Austria and no immediate threats. Final Plan: F AEG S F GRE - AEG, A VEN H, A ROM H.

France proposes a potential alliance against Germany which could be useful once Turkey is resolved. Germany proposes a joint action against England, which conflicts with our plan with England. Italy wants to continue the joint attack on Turkey until they are fully defeated. Turkey proposes a joint plan against Austria, but it makes more sense to keep Austria as an ally until Turkey is defeated. Plan: Agree with Austria's plan for F BLA to support an attack on CON or move to ANK while A RUM makes a defensive move. Agree to England's joint action against Germany where F SWE moves to Kiel supported by F DEN. Express a neutral stance to France but show interest in a potential alliance against Germany once Turkey is resolved. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany but be non-committal about a joint action against England. Agree with Italy's plan to continue the joint attack on Turkey until they are fully defeated. Keep Turkey in a false sense of security by reaffirming the non-aggression pact and DMZ in the Black Sea but make vague promises about a joint plan against Austria.

[2025-04-15 03:06:50.289]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: Austria is a significant threat to Turkey's goals in the Balkans. Austria currently holds Bulgaria and Greece, which are key territories for Turkey. Germany has proposed a non-aggression pact and a coordinated effort where Turkey focuses on the Balkans while Germany focuses on the north and west. Italy has proposed a temporary truce and a joint action against Austria. Russia has expressed openness to a non-aggression pact and a DMZ in the Black Sea while recognizing Austria as a major threat. Main priority should be to make a strategic alliance against Austria with Italy and Russia. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and DMZ in the Black Sea with Russia. Propose a joint plan against Austria where Turkey aims to recapture Greece and possibly move into Bulgaria while Russia keeps Rumania. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Italy and propose a joint plan against Austria where Italy could support Turkish moves in the Balkans such as supporting a Turkish move into Greece or putting pressure on Austria from the west. Respond to Germany by reaffirming the non-aggression pact and expressing a willingness to cooperate against a common enemy such as Russia if necessary, but for now, the main focus should be on Austria. Respond to Austria by making a firm demand for them to vacate Greece and possibly Bulgaria. If Austria is not willing to give up Greece, make it clear that any new proposals need to be carefully considered and that Turkey needs to make sure that its territories are protected.

[2025-04-15 03:24:27.788]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Reasoning: Turkey is on the defensive and needs to be fully defeated. Italy should aim for Smyrna (SMY) while Austria holds onto Constantinople (CON) and Bulgaria (BUL). Russia should aim for Ankara (ANK) and Serbia (SER). Germany should be reassured of the non-aggression pact. Plan: Propose joint attack on Turkey to Italy and Russia, reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany, and decline any new proposals from Turkey.

For Germany, reaffirm the DMZ in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and try to understand Germany's intentions. For Russia, reaffirm the non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia where England aims for Norway and Russia aims for Sweden, and propose a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Kiel where F DEN could support a potential Russian move from Sweden (F SWE-KIE supported by F DEN-KIE).

However, there seems to be a mistake in the unit description where it shows a unit '*A BEL' for Germany which should be 'F BEL' for England. We need to make sure that our alliance with England is still strong and that they do not make any aggressive moves against us. Reaffirm DMZ in BUR with Germany and make sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards us. Reaffirm non-aggression pact in the Western Mediterranean with Italy and make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards us. Make sure that Russia does not make any aggressive moves towards us.

A BUL should support Austria's A CON. For the north, need to make sure England supports F SWE to Kiel. Keep Germany neutral with a non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia.

[2025-04-15 03:30:18.956]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Reasoning: The main goal is to continue the joint attack on Turkey until it is fully defeated.

Italy wants to make a move on TUN and needs support for F ION to move from AEG to ION. Russia wants to make a move on ANK and proposes a division of Turkish territories once Turkey is defeated (ANK for Russia and SMY for Austria). Turkey demands that we vacate Greece and Bulgaria, which should be declined. Plan: Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany and postpone joint action against Russia until Turkey is defeated.

Russia proposes a joint action where their fleet in Sweden should move to Kiel supported by our fleet in Denmark. Plan: Reaffirm alliance with France and propose a joint action where France supports England's hold on Belgium and makes a move against Germany's unit in Holland or Burgundy. To Germany, explain that the dislodgment was a strategic move to secure a key supply center and reaffirm DMZ agreements in NTH and BAL. To Russia, agree to support their fleet in Sweden moving to Kiel with our fleet in Denmark and make sure that any division of German territories should be fair and mutually beneficial once Germany is weakened.

Germany seeks a non-aggression pact which could secure the western front. Italy is part of the alliance against Turkey. Turkey is trying to make a last-ditch effort to turn the tables. Plan: Agree to continue joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy (F BLA S A SEV-ANK, A GAL-SER if possible). Agree to a joint action against Germany with England (F SWE-KIE supported by F DEN-KIE). Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ with Germany. Keep Turkey in a false sense of security by reaffirming non-aggression pact and DMZ in Black Sea while making vague promises about a joint plan against Austria.

[2025-04-15 03:35:54.145]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: Austria is hostile and aims to keep Bulgaria, Greece, and Constantinople until Turkey is defeated. Italy is open to an alliance against Austria but wants specific actions that benefit both parties. Russia wants to keep the Black Sea DMZ and is open to a joint plan against Austria once Austria is weakened. Plan: Propose a joint plan to Italy where Italy supports Turkey in recapturing Greece and possibly Bulgaria while Italy gains some advantage elsewhere. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and DMZ in the Black Sea with Russia and propose a joint plan where Russia supports Turkey in recapturing Greece and Bulgaria.

However, a direct confrontation might be risky. Reaffirm DMZ in the English Channel (ENG) with England and make sure that England does not make any aggressive moves towards France's home centers such as Brest (BRE) or Paris (PAR).

Russia should be reassured that the non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia will be respected.

Thus, a non-aggression pact with Germany seems reasonable, but any joint action against Russia should be approached cautiously until the situation with Austria is resolved. Italy is not yet ready to commit to an alliance against Austria until they feel more secure. Russia has proposed a joint plan against Austria once both powers have stabilized their positions. Plan: Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany and express willingness to discuss joint action against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved.

Based on the messages, England is open to a joint action against Germany where France could support England's hold on Belgium or make a move against Germany such as attacking Holland (HOL) or Kiel (KIE). Germany reaffirms the DMZ in BUR and makes sure that there are no aggressive moves from Germany towards France. Italy reaffirms the non-aggression pact in the Western Mediterranean and states that their focus is on Turkey. Russia acknowledges interest in a future alliance against Germany or England once Turkey is resolved. 

Final Plan: 
1. F POR should move to MAO to keep options open for future moves such as supporting a move to the English Channel (ENG) or the North Atlantic Ocean (NAO). 
2. F BRE should also move to MAO to join forces with F POR and keep options open for future moves. 
3. A PAR should support A BUR's move to Holland (A PAR S A BUR - HOL). 
4. A MAR should also support A BUR's move to Holland (A MAR S A BUR - HOL).

F SWE should support F DEN - KIE (F SWE S F DEN - KIE) as proposed by England. F BLA should move to Ankara (F BLA - ANK) to attack Turkey's fleet there. A MOS should hold (A MOS H) for defense. A BUL should move to Constantinople (A BUL - CON) to attack any unit there (though Austria holds CON, so it might need a strategic plan such as A BUL S F BLA - ANK if F BLA is moving to ANK). A SEV should move to Armenia (A SEV - ARM) to attack Turkey's unit in Smyrna (A SMY) or support an attack on Ankara (ANK) such as A SEV S F BLA - ANK.

[2025-04-15 04:28:23.049]         >> Thought (FRANCE): Reasoning: England has a strong presence in the North Sea and has captured Belgium and Denmark from Germany. It is important to reaffirm the DMZ in the English Channel and make sure that England does not make any aggressive moves towards us. However, it might be worth discussing a continued joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Holland (HOL) or another German center such as Kiel (KIE) or Berlin (BER). Germany has been weakened by England's advances and now only holds four supply centers. It might be worth continuing the DMZ in Burgundy (BUR) to keep a peaceful border while focusing on a joint action with England against Germany. Another option could be to make a peace deal with Germany where we agree not to attack each other while focusing on other fronts. Italy only has three supply centers which makes them a potential target for expansion, but our non-aggression pact in the Western Mediterranean should be reaffirmed. Russia is currently the strongest power and seems to be focused on Turkey. It might be worth reaching out to Russia again to express a continued interest in a potential future alliance against Germany or England once Russia has resolved its situation with Turkey. Austria and Turkey seem to be in a conflict with each other and with Russia, so it might be worth reaching out to make sure that they do not make any aggressive moves towards us or Italy. Final Plan: Reaffirm DMZ in ENG with England and propose a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Holland (HOL) or another German center such as Kiel (KIE) or Berlin (BER). Reaffirm DMZ in BUR with Germany and make sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards us. Reaffirm non-aggression pact in the Western Mediterranean with Italy.

[2025-04-15 04:32:45.396]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: Russia has a fleet in the Black Sea (F BLA) which could be a threat to Ankara. However, Russia has been a more reliable ally against Austria so far. Austria has an army in Constantinople (A CON) and a fleet in the Aegean Sea (F AEG), which makes it a significant threat. Italy has a fleet in the Ionian Sea (F ION) which could be a potential ally against Austria. Germany could be a potential ally against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved. Plan: 1) Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Russia and propose a joint plan against Austria where Turkey aims for Greece and Constantinople while Russia keeps Bulgaria and Rumania. 2) Demand that Austria vacate Constantinople and make a new agreement where Turkey aims for Greece and Constantinople while Austria focuses on defending against Russia. 3) Propose a potential alliance against Austria where Turkey aims to recapture Greece and possibly move into Bulgaria while Italy supports Turkish moves in the Balkans. 4) Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany and express willingness to discuss joint action against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved.

[2025-04-15 04:38:30.038]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Based on the current game state and the messages received, it seems that Austria is determined to keep Bulgaria, Greece, and Constantinople until Turkey is fully defeated. This makes Austria a significant threat. Germany has reaffirmed a non-aggression pact and expressed interest in a joint action against Russia once their northern front stabilizes. Russia suggests a final push against Austria and proposes that Turkey makes a defensive move in Serbia while Russia supports from Bulgaria. However, the main goal for Turkey should be to secure the Black Sea and aim for the Balkans (Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, and Rumania).

Based on this, the main priority should be to make a strategic alliance with Russia against Austria while keeping an eye on Germany's offer for a future joint action against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved. However, the immediate priority should be to make a coordinated effort with Russia to push Austria out of the Balkans and secure key centers such as Greece and Constantinople.

1. To Russia, I should propose a joint plan where Turkey aims to recapture Constantinople and Greece while Russia keeps Bulgaria and Rumania. It makes sense to make a defensive move in Serbia while Russia supports from Bulgaria.
2. To Germany, I should reaffirm the non-aggression pact and express willingness to discuss a joint action against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved.
3. To Austria, I should make a firm demand that they vacate Constantinople and make a new agreement where Turkey aims for Greece and Constantinople while Austria focuses on defending against Russia. However, given Austria's message, it seems unlikely that they will agree to any new proposals until Turkey is fully defeated, so a more aggressive stance might be necessary.
4. To Italy, I should propose a potential alliance against Austria where Turkey aims to recapture Greece and possibly move into Bulgaria while Italy supports Turkish moves in the Balkans.

Based on this reasoning, the plan for this round should be:
- Send a message to Russia proposing a joint plan against Austria where Turkey aims for Greece and Constantinople while Russia keeps Bulgaria and Rumania.
- Send a message to Germany reaffirming the non-aggression pact and expressing willingness to discuss a joint action against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved.
- Send a message to Austria demanding that they vacate Constantinople and make a new agreement where Turkey aims for Greece and Constantinople while Austria focuses on defending against Russia.
- Send a message to Italy proposing a potential alliance against Austria where Turkey aims to recapture Greece and possibly move into Bulgaria while Italy supports Turkish moves in the Balkans.
- Update memory with the new proposals and messages sent.

England has proposed a joint action against Germany where A BUR could support F BEL-HOL or another option where F NTH could support A BUR-KIE. Germany has proposed a non-aggression pact and a joint action against England. Italy reaffirms the non-aggression pact in the Western Mediterranean. Russia is interested in a future alliance against Germany or England once their situation with Turkey is resolved. Based on the balance of power, it might make sense to support the weaker power (Germany) against the stronger power (England). However, the joint action plan with England against Germany seems well-defined and could be a good way to make gains against Germany if we trust England's intentions. Thus, the plan is: F POR H, F BRE H, A PAR H, A MAR H, A BUR - HOL (supported by F BEL - HOL).

To continue the joint attack on Turkey until it is fully defeated, A GAL should move to Serbia (A GAL - SER) to attack Turkey's unit there. F SWE should move to Denmark (F SWE - DEN) for a strategic position against England or Germany. F BLA should move to Ankara (F BLA - ANK) to attack Turkey's fleet there. A MOS should hold (A MOS H) for now unless there is a need to make a defensive move. A BUL should support A GAL's move to Serbia (A BUL S A GAL - SER).

Russia has a fleet in BLA which makes us question the DMZ agreement. However, Russia reaffirms the non-aggression pact and DMZ in the Black Sea. The main goal should be to recapture supply centers from Austria such as Constantinople and Greece. A possible plan could be: F ANK - CON (attempt to recapture Constantinople from Austria's A CON), A SMY S F ANK - CON (support the fleet's move from ANK to CON), and A SER - GRE (move to recapture Greece which is currently an Austrian supply center but not occupied by an Austrian unit).

[2025-04-15 04:50:23.533]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Reasoning: Turkey is on the brink of defeat with only three supply centers (ANK, SMY, GRE) and three units (F ANK, A SMY, A GRE). Russia has grown significantly and now has eight supply centers and six units. Italy has three supply centers and three units and seems to be a weaker ally compared to Russia. England has six supply centers and six units and seems to be a significant power in the north. France has five supply centers and five units and seems to be a mid-tier power. Germany has three supply centers and four units (and needs to disband one unit), making it a weaker power. Plan: Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy and continue joint attack on Turkey until it is fully defeated. Once Turkey is defeated, make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards Austria's core territories (VIE, BUD, TRI) and that Austria does not make any aggressive moves towards Italy's core territories (NAP, ROM, VEN). Discuss the distribution of Turkish territories once Turkey is defeated (ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and perhaps Italy should aim for SER or another center such as TUN). Reaffirm the joint attack on Turkey until it is fully defeated with Russia. Once Turkey is defeated, make sure that Russia does not make any aggressive moves towards Austria's core territories (VIE, BUD, TRI) and that Austria does not make any aggressive moves towards Russia's core territories. Discuss the distribution of Turkish territories once Turkey is defeated (ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and BUL should be a point of discussion as it was part of the plan for Austria to keep, but Russia has already taken it). Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Germany and make sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards Austria's core territories. Given that Germany needs to disband a unit, it might be worth discussing any potential future plans once Turkey is fully defeated. Politely decline any new proposals from Turkey and reaffirm that Austria needs to keep Bulgaria, Greece, and Constantinople secure until Turkey is fully defeated.

Reaffirm non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia with England while proposing a joint action against Germany.

[2025-04-15 04:54:52.800]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: Turkey needs to secure the Black Sea and aim for the Balkans (Bul, Gre, Ser, Rum). Russia is a significant power with 2 builds available and already has units in BUL and ARM, making them a potential threat. Austria has units in CON and AEG, which makes them a direct threat to Turkey's position in GRE and SMY. Italy has a unit in ION which could be a threat to GRE but has been a potential ally against Austria. Germany needs to disband a unit and might be looking for allies. Plan: (1) Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Russia and propose a joint plan against Austria where Turkey aims for Greece and possibly recapture Constantinople while Russia keeps Bulgaria and Rumania. (2) Propose a new agreement with Austria where Turkey aims for Greece and Constantinople while Austria focuses on defending against Russia. (3) Propose a potential alliance with Italy against Austria where Turkey aims to recapture Greece and possibly move into Bulgaria while Italy supports Turkish moves in the Balkans. (4) Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany and express willingness to discuss a joint action against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved.

Russia proposes that ANK and SMY should go to Russia while Austria should take GRE. Turkey proposes a new agreement where Turkey aims for Greece and Constantinople while Austria should focus on defending against Russia. Plan: Agree with Italy's proposal that ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. However, make sure that Austria keeps CON. For Russia, agree to continue the joint attack on Turkey until it is fully defeated, but argue that a fair division should be that ANK should go to Russia while SMY should go to Austria.

Germany wants us to vacate Kiel so they can recapture it and suggests a joint action against Russia's fleet in Denmark. Russia reaffirms a non-aggression pact and proposes a joint action against Germany where they can support us in capturing Berlin or Munich. Plan: To France, propose a joint attack on Holland where F BEL supports A BUR-HOL. To Germany, propose a joint action against Russia's fleet in Denmark where F HEL supports F NTH-DEN. To Russia, propose that they move F DEN-BAL and make a joint action against Germany's fleet in Helgoland Bight where F NTH supports F DEN-HEL.

[2025-04-15 04:57:54.987]         >> Thought (GERMANY): Reasoning: Germany needs to disband one unit due to having 4 units and only 3 supply centers. The main threats are England (holding KIE and BEL) and Russia (growing power with 8 supply centers). England proposes a joint action against Russia, while France proposes a joint action against England. Russia also proposes a joint action against England. Plan: Reaffirm DMZ in NTH and BAL with England, but demand that England vacates KIE and BEL. Reaffirm DMZ in BUR with France and agree to a joint action against England. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Russia, but make sure any joint action against England does not make Russia stronger at Germany's expense. Reaffirm non-aggression pacts with Austria and Turkey and express willingness to discuss future joint actions against Russia once their conflict is resolved. Disbanding A BER might make sense if the main threat is from the west, but A BER is also important for defense against Russia. Another option might be to disband F HEL if the main threat is from the east, but F HEL is important for naval power in the North Sea. A decision on which unit to disband should be made based on which alliance seems most promising.

[2025-04-15 05:03:21.988]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: Russia has 8 supply centers (MOS, SEV, STP, WAR, SWE, RUM, BUL, DEN) and 6 units (A GAL, F BLA, A MOS, A BUL, A ARM, F DEN), so it needs to build 2 units. The home supply centers are MOS, SEV, STP, and WAR. Since A MOS is already in MOS, the vacant home supply centers are SEV, STP, and WAR. A fleet in St. Petersburg (north coast) could be useful for operations in the Baltic Sea or North Sea. An army in SEV could be useful for operations against Turkey or Austria. Another option is to build an army in WAR for operations in Galicia or central Europe. Based on the previous round's plan, a fleet in St. Petersburg seems like a solid choice. Another unit could be an army in SEV. Final Plan: Build a fleet in St. Petersburg (north coast) (F STP/NC B) and an army in Sevastopol (A SEV B).

The main goal now is to make sure that once Turkey is defeated, Austria should aim to keep CON and possibly SMY. However, Russia has grown significantly stronger and now holds BUL which was part of the plan for Austria to keep. Thus, it is important to make sure that once Turkey is defeated, Austria should aim to keep CON and SMY while Russia keeps ANK and BUL. Italy should aim for GRE and possibly another center such as TUN. It is also important to reaffirm non-aggression pacts with Italy and Germany. Plan: Propose to Italy that we continue the joint attack on Turkey until it is fully defeated and that once Turkey is defeated, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. Reaffirm non-aggression pact where Austria does not move into VEN or ADR and Italy does not move into TRI or ALB. Propose to Russia that we continue the joint attack on Turkey until it is fully defeated and that once Turkey is defeated, ANK should go to Russia while SMY should go to Austria.

[2025-04-15 05:34:57.589]         >> Thought (ITALY): Reasoning: The joint attack against Turkey seems to be making progress. Austria has captured SER and now holds CON and SMY (although SMY needs to be disbanded or rebuilt). Turkey still holds ANK, SMY, and GRE. The plan was that once Turkey is defeated, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and Italy should aim for GRE or TUN. Since Italy already has a fleet in TUN, it makes sense to aim for GRE as well. Thus, I need to reaffirm the joint attack plan with Austria and Russia until Turkey is fully defeated and make sure that Austria and Russia agree that Italy should aim for GRE once Turkey is defeated. Additionally, I need to reaffirm non-aggression pacts with France and Germany.

[2025-04-15 05:36:18.489]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: Turkey is on the brink of defeat with only three centers (ANK, SMY, GRE) and a unit in CON and a dislodged unit in SMY. The joint attack on Turkey should continue until they are completely eliminated. Austria is a strong ally against Turkey but might become a rival once Turkey is defeated. England is a strong power in the north with a fleet in KIE. Germany is a weaker power with only three centers. France is a neutral power with five centers. Italy is a weaker power with three centers. Plan: Propose a continued joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy until Turkey is fully defeated. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia with England. Express interest in a future alliance against Germany with France once Turkey is resolved. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Germany. Keep Turkey in a false sense of security until they are fully defeated.

[2025-04-15 05:37:24.765]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Based on the current game state and the overall goal, it seems that the main focus should be on securing the Black Sea and aiming for the Balkans (Bul, Gre, Ser, Rum). However, the current situation shows that Austria has captured Serbia from Turkey and Turkey has captured Greece from Austria. The main conflict seems to be with Austria and Russia. 

1. **Current Units and Supply Centers:**
   - **Turkey's Units:** A GRE, F CON, *A SMY (disbanded unit in Smyrna).
   - **Turkey's Supply Centers:** ANK, SMY, GRE.
   - **Austria's Units:** A VIE, F TRI, F AEG, A SER, A SMY.
   - **Austria's Supply Centers:** BUD, TRI, VIE, CON, SER.
   - **Russia's Units:** A GAL, F BLA, A MOS, A BUL, A ARM, F DEN, F STP/NC, A SEV.
   - **Russia's Supply Centers:** MOS, SEV, STP, WAR, SWE, RUM, BUL, DEN.

2. **Analysis of the Current Situation:**
   - **Austria has a unit in Smyrna (A SMY) which is a significant threat to Turkey's home centers (ANK and SMY).
   - **Russia has a unit in Bulgaria (A BUL) and a fleet in the Black Sea (F BLA), which makes it a potential threat to Turkey's position in the Black Sea and the Balkans.
   - **Turkey has a fleet in Constantinople (F CON) which is a strategic position but needs to be protected from both Austrian and Russian threats.
   - **Turkey has an army in Greece (A GRE) which is a good position to either defend Greece or make a move towards Bulgaria or Serbia.

3. **Communication Strategy:**
   - **Russia:** It seems that Russia has been a part of a non-aggression pact and a DMZ in the Black Sea. However, Russia has a strong presence in the Balkans and the Black Sea. It might be important to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and possibly make a new agreement where Turkey aims for Greece and possibly recaptures Constantinople while Russia keeps Bulgaria and Rumania. However, Russia's growing power might make it a future threat.
   - **Austria:** The main conflict seems to be with Austria. Turkey should demand that Austria vacate Constantinople and make a new agreement where Turkey aims for Greece and Constantinople while Austria focuses on defending against Russia. However, Austria's unit in Smyrna is a direct threat to Turkey's home centers.
   - **Italy:** Italy seems to be a potential ally against Austria. Turkey should propose a potential alliance against Austria where Turkey aims to recapture Greece and possibly move into Bulgaria while Italy supports Turkish moves in the Balkans.
   - **Germany:** Germany seems to be a potential ally against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved. Turkey should reaffirm non-aggression pact and express willingness to discuss a joint action against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved.

4. **Planned Actions for This Round:**
   - **Send a message to Russia to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and propose a new agreement where Turkey aims for Greece and possibly recaptures Constantinople while Russia keeps Bulgaria and Rumania.
   - **Send a message to Austria demanding that they vacate Constantinople and make a new agreement where Turkey aims for Greece and Constantinople while Austria focuses on defending against Russia.
   - **Send a message to Italy proposing a potential alliance against Austria where Turkey aims to recapture Greece and possibly move into Bulgaria while Italy supports Turkish moves in the Balkans.
   - **Send a message to Germany reaffirming non-aggression pact and expressing willingness to discuss a joint action against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved.
   - **Update memory with the new proposals and agreements made in this round.

Italy and Russia both want to continue the joint attack on Turkey until it is fully defeated. Italy proposes that once Turkey is defeated, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and Italy should aim for GRE. Russia wants to make sure Turkey is completely out of the game first. Turkey's proposal to vacate Constantinople and make a new agreement should be declined. Plan: Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany and express willingness to discuss a joint action against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Agree with Italy's plan and confirm that once Turkey is out, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and Italy should aim for GRE.

Germany wants us to vacate Kiel so that they can retake it and then discuss a joint action against Russia's fleet in Denmark. Russia wants to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia. Plan: Reaffirm DMZ in ENG with France and agree to support A BUR-HOL with F BEL. Decline Germany's request to vacate Kiel and instead propose a joint action against Russia where Germany supports us in holding Kiel. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Russia and propose a joint action against Germany once Turkey is fully defeated.

Germany reaffirms the DMZ in Burgundy and suggests that France should focus on Italy or England while Germany handles the situation in the north. Italy wants to reaffirm the non-aggression pact. Russia is interested in a future alliance against Germany once Turkey is resolved. Plan: Reaffirm DMZ in ENG with England and agree to a coordinated attack on Holland where F BEL supports A BUR-HOL. Reaffirm DMZ in BUR with Germany while making sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards us. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy.

Turkey's proposal for an alliance against Austria should be declined. Plan: Reaffirm joint attack plan with Austria and Russia until Turkey is defeated. Agree on post-Turkey division plan (ANK to Russia, SMY to Austria, GRE to Italy). Reaffirm non-aggression pacts with France and Germany.

Final Plan: A SMY should retreat to ANK.

Reaffirm the DMZ in the North Sea (NTH) and Baltic Sea (BAL) and propose a joint action against Russia such as a coordinated attack on Denmark where F KIE supports F HEL-DEN. However, given Germany's weakened state, it might be worth making a more aggressive move against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Holland where F BEL supports F KIE-HOL. Russia has a fleet in Denmark (F DEN) which makes them a significant threat. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and propose a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Kiel where F KIE could be supported by F DEN.

However, F KIE should be used for a different purpose such as defending Kiel. Germany wants us to vacate Kiel so they can retake it and then work together against Russia. However, Germany is weak and it makes sense to keep Kiel and make a joint action against Germany until they are out. Russia reaffirms non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia and proposes that F DEN supports any moves against Germany.

Germany wants to reaffirm the DMZ in Burgundy (BUR) and asks us to make sure Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards them. Italy reaffirms the non-aggression pact and remains open to future cooperation once the situation with Turkey is resolved. Russia is interested in a future alliance against Germany once Turkey is defeated. Plan: Agree to the DMZ in ENG with England and support the joint action against Germany (A BUR-HOL supported by F BEL), while discussing who should take control of Holland if the attack is successful.

France reaffirms the DMZ in BUR but mentions a coalition against Germany. Italy reaffirms non-aggression and future cooperation once Turkey is resolved. Russia reaffirms non-aggression and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia. Turkey reaffirms non-aggression and future joint action against Russia once Austria is resolved.

It is important to reaffirm the DMZ in the English Channel (ENG) and make sure that England does not make any aggressive moves against France. Germany is weakened and holds only 3 centers, so it is important to reaffirm the DMZ in Burgundy (BUR) and make sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards France. Italy has been a non-aggression partner in the Western Mediterranean, so it is important to reaffirm that pact. Russia is a major power and a potential future ally against Germany once they resolve their situation with Turkey, so it is important to check in with them.

[2025-04-15 08:31:33.204]         >> Thought (ITALY): Reasoning: Turkey is on the brink of defeat with only three supply centers (ANK, SMY, GRE) and two units (A GRE and A SMY). The alliance with Austria and Russia should be reaffirmed until Turkey is fully defeated. The post-Turkey division plan should be reiterated where ANK goes to Russia, SMY goes to Austria, and GRE goes to Italy. Non-aggression pacts with France and Germany should be reaffirmed. Any new proposals from Turkey for an alliance against Austria should be politely declined.

Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Germany. Express continued interest in a future alliance against Germany with France once Turkey is resolved.

[2025-04-15 08:33:34.277]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: Turkey is in a very weak position with only 3 supply centers and 2 units. Russia has a unit in ANK and a fleet in BLA, while Austria has a unit in CON and a fleet in AEG. The main goal should be to make a truce with Russia to retake ANK and make a similar deal with Austria to retake CON. Another potential ally could be Italy to help against Austria. Germany might be a potential ally against Russia. Plan: Propose a truce to Russia where they vacate ANK and allow Turkey to retake it. Propose a similar truce to Austria where they vacate CON. Propose a joint plan to Italy where they support Turkey in retaking CON from Austria. Propose a joint plan to Germany where they put pressure on Russia from the north.

Italy wants to continue the alliance until Turkey is fully defeated and agrees that ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. Russia wants to continue the joint attack on Turkey but suggests that they aim for SMY while Austria should aim for GRE. Turkey proposes a truce where Austria vacates CON.

However, a DMZ in the English Channel might be a good idea to keep peace. A joint action against Germany could be beneficial if it helps us gain a new center such as Holland (HOL). Germany is weak and on the defensive, so a joint action plan against England might be a good idea if it helps us gain a new center such as Belgium (BEL) or Holland (HOL). Reaffirming the non-aggression pact with Italy makes sense. Acknowledging Russia's interest in a future alliance against Germany makes sense once Turkey is fully defeated. Plan: Reaffirm DMZ in ENG with England and agree to a joint action against Germany where we support an attack on Holland (HOL). Reaffirm DMZ in BUR with Germany and make sure Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards Germany. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy and express a willingness to discuss future cooperation once Turkey is defeated.

However, the only valid retreat options for a unit dislodged from Ankara are Smyrna (SMY) or Constantinople (CON).

[2025-04-15 08:58:26.640]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Reasoning: The main strategic plan has been a joint attack on Turkey until it is fully defeated. The plan was that once Turkey is defeated, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. However, Russia has already captured ANK in the last round (F1905R). Thus, it is important to make sure that the plan for SMY and GRE is still valid. Plan: Reaffirm the alliance with Italy and Russia until Turkey is fully defeated. Confirm that once Turkey is out, SMY should go to Austria and GRE should go to Italy. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Germany and make sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards Austria's core territories (VIE, BUD, TRI).

France has a fleet in the English Channel which could be a threat to our home centers. Germany has recaptured Kiel and has a unit in Holland which could threaten Belgium. Plan: Reaffirm DMZ in ENG with France and propose a joint action against Germany where France supports us in holding BEL. Negotiate a safe retreat for any units that need to be repositioned with Germany and make a joint action plan against Russia where Germany supports us in retaking DEN. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Russia and suggest that Russia should focus on other fronts such as against Austria or Turkey. Update memory with the proposals made.

[2025-04-15 09:00:31.760]         >> Thought (FRANCE): Reasoning: France has 5 units and 5 supply centers, so no builds or disbands are needed. The main focus should be on maintaining a DMZ in ENG with England and BUR with Germany while continuing a non-aggression pact with Italy. Given that Russia has captured ANK from Turkey and seems close to resolving its conflict with Turkey, it might be a good time to reach out to Russia for a potential alliance against Germany. Plan: Reaffirm DMZ in ENG with England, DMZ in BUR with Germany, non-aggression pact with Italy, and reach out to Russia for a potential alliance against Germany.

[2025-04-15 09:01:28.399]         >> Thought (GERMANY): Reasoning: Germany needs to make a build decision and should build a unit in Berlin (BER) as it is a supply center currently without a unit. Communication strategy should focus on reaffirming DMZs with England (NTH and BAL) and France (BUR), while proposing joint actions against Russia given their dominant position. Propose that England vacates Belgium so that Germany can secure it. Reaffirm non-aggression pacts with Russia, Austria, Italy, and Turkey while expressing interest in future cooperation against Russia once their current conflicts are resolved. Plan: Build a new unit in Berlin (BER), send messages to England, France, and Russia.

[2025-04-15 09:02:24.513]         >> Thought (ITALY): Reasoning: Turkey is on the brink of defeat with only two supply centers (SMY and GRE) and two units (A GRE and A SMY). The alliance with Austria and Russia should be reaffirmed until Turkey is fully defeated. The plan for post-Turkey division should be reiterated where ANK goes to Russia, SMY goes to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. Additionally, Italy should aim for TUN once Turkey is defeated. Non-aggression pacts with France and Germany should be reaffirmed. Plan: Propose a coordinated attack on the remaining Turkish units (A GRE and A SMY) with Austria and Russia. Reiterate the post-Turkey division plan where ANK goes to Russia, SMY goes to Austria, and GRE goes to Italy. Reaffirm non-aggression pacts with France and Germany. Politely decline any new proposals from Turkey.

[2025-04-15 09:03:24.232]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: The main focus should be on continuing the joint attack on Turkey until it is fully defeated. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia with England. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Germany. Express continued interest in a future alliance against Germany with France once Turkey is resolved. Given that Russia has one build available, a new unit should be built, likely a fleet in St. Petersburg (F STP) for future naval operations in the north. Plan: Propose a joint attack on Turkey until fully defeated with Austria and Italy where A ANK should move to SMY supported by F BLA and A SEV should support A ANK to SMY. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia with England. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Germany.

[2025-04-15 09:04:03.140]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: Turkey needs to stabilize its position by retaking Ankara and Constantinople. Propose a truce to Russia where they vacate Ankara and allow Turkey to retake it. Similarly, propose a truce to Austria where they vacate Constantinople and allow Turkey to retake it. Propose a joint plan to Italy where they support Turkey in retaking Constantinople from Austria. Finally, propose a joint plan to Germany where they put pressure on Russia from the north while Turkey tries to stabilize its position in the south. Plan: Send messages to Russia, Austria, Italy, and Germany.

Plan: Respond to England that a coalition against Russia might be a good idea once Turkey is fully defeated.

Germany has proposed a joint action against Russia and wants us to vacate Belgium so that they can secure it. However, vacating Belgium might make us lose a supply center unless there is a significant strategic gain. France wants to continue our joint action against Germany. However, a realignment might be necessary to counter Russia's growing power. Plan: Reaffirm DMZ in ENG with France and express a need to focus on a new threat (Russia) while still keeping an eye on Germany. Negotiate with Germany on a joint action against Russia while making sure that any plan does not make us lose a supply center. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Russia while making sure that we do not reveal any plans against them until a solid alliance with Germany is established.

[2025-04-15 09:07:51.666]         >> Thought (GERMANY): Reasoning: Germany has one build available due to recapturing Kiel. The most logical place to build a unit would be in Berlin (BER) because it is a home supply center and currently has no unit stationed there. A new army in Berlin could be useful for either defending against Russia or making a move towards the west if necessary. For the messages, reaffirm non-aggression pacts and DMZs with Austria (VIE, BUD, TRI), England (NTH and BAL), France (BUR), Italy, and Russia (Baltic Sea and Galicia). Acknowledge England's proposal for a joint action against Russia and reaffirm the DMZ in NTH and BAL. For Turkey, acknowledge the proposal for a joint plan against Russia once Turkey stabilizes its position. Plan: Build an army in Berlin (A BER).

[2025-04-15 09:09:03.727]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: The main goal is to fully defeat Turkey. Austria and Italy should be reassured that once Turkey is out, ANK goes to Russia, SMY goes to Austria, and GRE goes to Italy. England should be reassured that the non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia still hold. France should be told that an alliance against Germany is still on the table once Turkey is resolved. Germany should be reassured that the non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia still hold. Turkey should be given a false sense of security until they are fully defeated. Plan: Reaffirm joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy, reaffirm non-aggression pact with England, express interest in a future alliance against Germany with France, reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany, and keep Turkey in a false sense of security.

[2025-04-15 09:09:58.154]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: Turkey is in a dire situation with only two supply centers (SMY and GRE) and two units (A GRE and A SMY). Russia has captured Ankara and holds a total of 9 supply centers, making it a dominant power. Austria still holds Constantinople and has a unit in the Aegean Sea. The main goal should be to make a deal with either Austria or Russia to retake one of the key centers (ANK or CON). Germany has reaffirmed a non-aggression pact and suggests a future alliance against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved. Plan: (1) Acknowledge Germany's message and express a willingness to cooperate against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved. (2) Propose a truce to Russia where they vacate Ankara and allow Turkey to retake it. (3) Propose a truce to Austria where they vacate Constantinople and allow Turkey to retake it. (4) Propose a joint plan to Italy where they support Turkey in retaking Constantinople from Austria.

We need to reaffirm the DMZ in the English Channel (ENG) and propose a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Holland (HOL) where A BUR could support F BEL in attacking HOL. For Germany, we need to reaffirm the DMZ in Burgundy (BUR) and make sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards us. For Italy, we need to reaffirm the non-aggression pact in the Western Mediterranean and make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards us. For Russia, it seems like a good time to discuss a potential alliance against Germany now that Russia seems to be in a strong position against Turkey. Final Plan: Propose joint action against Germany with England, reaffirm DMZ in BUR with Germany, reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy, and reach out to Russia for a potential alliance against Germany.

Additionally, reaffirming non-aggression pacts with France and Germany is important. Plan: Propose a coordinated attack on GRE and SMY where F ION moves to AEG to support an attack on GRE or SMY. Once Turkey is fully defeated, make sure that GRE is given to Italy as previously agreed. Reaffirm non-aggression pacts with France and Germany.

Russia has captured Ankara and holds the Black Sea, while Austria holds Constantinople and has a fleet in the Aegean Sea. The priority should be to make a truce with Russia to prevent further losses and possibly retake Ankara. Similarly, a truce with Austria could help us retake Constantinople. Italy could be a potential ally against Austria or Russia. Germany might be a potential ally against Russia. Plan: Propose a truce to Russia where they vacate Ankara and allow us to retake it. Propose a truce to Austria where they vacate Constantinople and allow us to retake it. Propose a joint plan to Italy where they support us in retaking Constantinople from Austria.

[2025-04-15 09:25:43.224]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: Austria and Italy both want to continue the joint attack on Turkey until it is fully defeated and agree on the division of Turkish territories (ANK to Russia, SMY to Austria, GRE to Italy, and CON stays with Austria). England is concerned about Russia's growing power and wants to reaffirm the non-aggression pact. France suggests a potential alliance against Germany once Turkey is resolved. Germany wants to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia and proposes a joint action to retake Belgium from England. Turkey requests a truce which should be rejected. Plan: Reaffirm joint attack plan with Austria and Italy, reassure England, express interest in a future alliance against Germany with France, reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany while being non-committal about retaking Belgium, and reject Turkey's truce request.

[2025-04-15 09:26:38.938]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: Germany has reaffirmed a non-aggression pact and expressed interest in a joint action against Russia once Turkey resolves its situation with Austria. Turkey needs to make a strategic decision on whether to make a truce with Austria where Austria vacates Constantinople and allows Turkey to retake it. Similarly, Turkey should propose a truce where Russia vacates Ankara and allows Turkey to retake it. Italy should be asked to support Turkey in retaking Constantinople from Austria. Final Plan: Acknowledge Germany's message and reaffirm the non-aggression pact. Propose a truce to Austria where they vacate Constantinople. Propose a truce to Russia where they vacate Ankara. Propose a joint plan to Italy where they support Turkey in retaking Constantinople from Austria.

F TRI should hold to maintain a defensive position and not provoke Italy. F AEG should support the attack on Smyrna from Constantinople.

Thus, the plan is: A LON should support F BEL in attacking Holland (A LON S F BEL - HOL), F LVP should hold (F LVP H), F NTH should support a potential German move from Kiel to Denmark (F NTH S F KIE - DEN), F BEL should move to Holland supported by A BUR and A LON (F BEL - HOL), and F EDI should move to the North Sea (F EDI - NTH) for additional support.

[2025-04-15 09:46:22.487]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: Turkey is nearly defeated with only two supply centers (SMY and GRE) and two units (A GRE and A SMY). The main goal should be to continue the joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy until Turkey is completely eliminated. Once Turkey is defeated, the next major target could be Austria or a new alliance against another power such as Germany or England. England has a significant naval presence which could be a threat if they turn against us, so maintaining a good relationship until Turkey is fully defeated is important. Germany has been a part of a non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia, but once Turkey is defeated, an alliance with France against Germany might be a good next step. France has been approached for a future alliance against Germany once Turkey is resolved. Italy has been a part of the joint attack on Turkey, but once Turkey is defeated, Italy might be a potential rival for control over the Mediterranean and the Balkans. Plan: 1) Propose a final joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy where A ANK should move to SMY supported by F BLA and A SEV should support A ANK to SMY. 2) Reaffirm non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia with England. 3) Reaffirm interest in a future alliance against Germany with France once Turkey is resolved. 4) Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Germany. 5) Keep Turkey in a false sense of security until they are fully defeated.

[2025-04-15 09:47:21.645]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Based on the current game state and the overall goal for Turkey, the main priority should be to secure the Black Sea and aim for the Balkans (Bul, Gre, Ser, Rum). However, the current game state shows that Turkey only has two units (A GRE and A SMY) and two supply centers (SMY and GRE). The situation is dire as Russia has captured Ankara (ANK), and Austria has captured Constantinople (CON).

To make a strategic plan, it's important to first analyze the current state and the main threats. Russia has a strong presence in the region with units in BLA, BUL, SEV, and ANK. Austria has units in VIE, TRI, AEG, SER, and CON. Given this, the main threats are Russia and Austria.

1. **Russia's Position**: Russia has a significant presence in the Black Sea and the Balkans. They hold ANK, BUL, SEV, and BLA. To make any progress, Turkey needs to negotiate with Russia to vacate Ankara and possibly make a truce where Turkey aims for Greece and Constantinople while Russia keeps Bulgaria and Rumania.

2. **Austria's Position**: Austria holds Constantinople and has a unit in AEG which could threaten Smyrna. Negotiating with Austria to vacate Constantinople is crucial for Turkey to regain a foothold.

3. **Italy's Position**: Italy has a unit in ION which could be a potential ally against Austria. A joint plan where Italy supports Turkey in retaking Constantinople from Austria could be beneficial.

4. **Germany's Position**: Germany seems to be a potential ally against Russia. A joint plan where Germany puts pressure on Russia from the north while Turkey tries to stabilize its position in the south could be a viable strategy.

Based on this reasoning, the plan for this round should be:
- Negotiate with Russia to vacate Ankara and make a truce where Turkey aims for Greece and Constantinople while Russia keeps Bulgaria and Rumania.
- Negotiate with Austria to vacate Constantinople and make a new agreement where Turkey aims for Greece and Constantinople while Austria focuses on defending against Russia.
- Negotiate with Italy for a joint plan where Italy supports Turkey in retaking Constantinople from Austria.
- Negotiate with Germany for a joint plan where Germany puts pressure on Russia from the north while Turkey tries to stabilize its position in the south.

This round should focus on making a truce with Russia and Austria to retake Ankara and Constantinople while seeking support from Italy and Germany.

Plan: Reaffirm the plan with Italy that ANK goes to Russia, SMY goes to Austria, and GRE goes to Italy. Agree with Russia's plan for a final push against Turkey.

[2025-04-15 09:52:48.217]         >> Thought (GERMANY): Reasoning: Russia is the dominant power with 9 supply centers and a fleet in Denmark. England holds Belgium which is a part of Germany's strategic interests. France proposes a DMZ in Burgundy and a potential joint action against England once Russia becomes a more significant threat. Austria is concerned about Germany making aggressive moves towards its core territories (VIE, BUD, TRI). Italy reaffirms a non-aggression pact and plans to make a move towards Tunis once Turkey is defeated. Turkey proposes a joint plan against Russia once it stabilizes its position against Austria. Plan: Reaffirm non-aggression pacts with Austria, Italy, and Russia. Propose that England vacates Belgium so that Germany can secure it and make a joint action against Russia. Reaffirm DMZ in Burgundy with France and propose a joint action against Russia once France makes sure Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards Germany. Acknowledge Turkey's proposal but make it clear that Germany needs to secure its borders first.

France reaffirms the non-aggression pact and suggests future cooperation against Russia. Germany reaffirms the non-aggression pact and suggests future cooperation once Turkey is resolved. Russia proposes a final push against Turkey and suggests a plan where A ANK moves to SMY supported by F BLA and A SEV should support A ANK to SMY. A BUL should move to GRE supported by A SEV if necessary. Turkey proposes a joint plan to retake Constantinople from Austria. Plan: Reaffirm joint attack plan with Austria and Russia until Turkey is defeated. Agree on post-Turkey division plan (ANK to Russia, SMY to Austria, GRE to Italy). Reaffirm non-aggression pacts with France and Germany. Politely decline Turkey's proposal for an alliance against Austria.

[2025-04-15 09:55:11.113]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Based on the current game state and the message from Germany, it seems that Germany is reaffirming a non-aggression pact and suggesting a joint action against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved. Given that Russia has captured Ankara and Austria has captured Constantinople, Turkey's main goal should be to stabilize its position and try to retake Ankara and possibly Constantinople. The main threats are Russia and Austria, so any alliance that helps Turkey regain control of its home centers should be considered. 

1. **Message from Germany**: Germany has reaffirmed the non-aggression pact and suggested a joint action against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved. This makes sense as Germany might be looking to weaken Russia while Turkey needs to regain control of Ankara and possibly Constantinople.
2. **Current Units and Supply Centers**: Turkey only has two units (A GRE and A SMY) and two supply centers (SMY and GRE). Russia has a strong presence in the region with units in BLA, BUL, SEV, and ANK. Austria has units in CON and AEG. 
3. **Strategy for Negotiation Round 2**:
   - **To Germany**: Acknowledge the reaffirmation of the non-aggression pact and express willingness to cooperate against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved. However, make it clear that Turkey needs to first retake Ankara from Russia and possibly Constantinople from Austria.
   - **To Russia**: Propose a truce where Russia vacates Ankara and allows Turkey to retake it. Emphasize that a stable Turkey could be a valuable ally against Austria and other potential threats.
   - **To Austria**: Propose a truce where Austria vacates Constantinople and allows Turkey to retake it. Emphasize that a stable Turkey could be a valuable ally against Russia.
   - **To Italy**: Propose a joint plan where Italy supports Turkey in retaking Constantinople from Austria. Italy might be interested in weakening Austria and could be a valuable ally.

Based on this reasoning, the plan for this round is to send messages to Germany, Russia, Austria, and Italy.

[2025-04-15 10:08:38.992]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: The only unit that needs a retreat order is F DEN which was dislodged by Germany. Valid retreat options are BAL, HEL, NTH, SKA, or SWE. However, NTH is occupied by England's fleet (F NTH), which makes it a risky retreat option. Given that Germany has reaffirmed a non-aggression pact and DMZ in the Baltic Sea, retreating to BAL might be a strategic move if Germany agrees. However, a more conservative and safe option might be to disband F DEN to make a statement of goodwill towards Germany and avoid any potential conflict. Final Plan: Disband F DEN.

Acknowledge any proposals from England or France for a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Plan: Reaffirm alliance with Italy and Russia, make a coordinated attack on Turkey's remaining units, and reaffirm non-aggression pacts.

Reaffirm non-aggression pact with England. Acknowledge France's request for a more concrete plan for a future alliance against Germany once Turkey is defeated. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ with Germany but be non-committal about a joint action against England until Turkey is fully defeated. Ignore Turkey's truce proposal and continue the joint attack until Turkey is fully defeated.

[2025-04-15 10:29:51.964]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: My units are A GRE and A SMY. Given that Austria, Russia, and Italy are all committed to continuing their attack until Turkey is 'fully defeated,' a defensive strategy seems most prudent. A GRE should hold to defend Greece (A GRE H), and A SMY should hold to defend Smyrna (A SMY H). Another possible plan could be to try to retake Constantinople with A SMY - CON supported by A GRE S A SMY - CON, but this seems risky given the support Austria might have from Italy and Russia. Another option could be A GRE - BUL, but Bulgaria is held by Russia (A BUL), which makes that also risky. Thus, holding seems the safest option for now.

[2025-04-15 10:43:24.963]         >> Thought (ITALY): Reasoning: The main priority is to make a final push against Turkey. Once Turkey is defeated, the plan is for ANK to go to Russia, SMY to Austria, and GRE to Italy. However, Russia's growing power (9 centers) makes it a dominant force on the board. Thus, a potential alliance against Russia might be necessary once Turkey is out. Plan: Reaffirm the joint attack plan with Austria and Russia against Turkey. Reaffirm non-aggression pacts with France and Germany. Acknowledge England's concern about Russia and express willingness to discuss a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Politely decline Turkey's proposal for a joint plan against Austria.

The only unit that seems to need a retreat is a German unit in Holland ("*A", "HOL"), which is not an English unit. Therefore, no retreat orders are needed for England's units.

[2025-04-15 11:02:23.170]         >> Thought (FRANCE): Reasoning: England has captured Holland from Germany and now has a unit in Holland (F HOL) and likely another in Belgium (since England has a supply center in Belgium). It is important to reaffirm the DMZ in the English Channel with England and make sure that England does not make any aggressive moves towards France's home centers such as Brest or Paris. Germany has been weakened and now has one build available. It might be worth reaffirming the DMZ in Burgundy with Germany and making sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards France. However, a potential joint action against England could be discussed if Germany feels threatened by England's expansion. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact in the Western Mediterranean with Italy and make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards France. Reach out to Russia to reaffirm the potential future alliance against Germany once Turkey is fully defeated and make sure that Russia does not make any aggressive moves towards Austria or Italy. Finally, reach out to Austria to make sure that they do not make any aggressive moves against Italy or potentially against France if they expand westward.

England has a strong presence in the north and captured Holland from Germany. Germany captured Denmark from Russia, which might need to be addressed. France could be a potential ally against Germany once Turkey is defeated. Plan: Reaffirm joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy until Turkey is fully defeated.

[2025-04-15 11:06:01.488]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Based on the current game state and the history of negotiations, it seems that Turkey is in a precarious position. The main goal for Turkey should be to secure the Black Sea and aim for the Balkans (Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, and Rumania). However, the current game state shows that Russia has a significant presence in the Balkans and has even captured Ankara (ANK), which is a part of Turkey's home supply centers. Additionally, Austria has captured Constantinople (CON), another one of Turkey's home supply centers. Thus, Turkey only has two units (A GRE and A SMY) and two supply centers (SMY and GRE).

To make a strategic plan, it is important to first analyze the current state and the history of negotiations. The main threats are Russia and Austria. However, it seems that there has been a consistent effort to make a non-aggression pact with Russia and a joint plan against Austria. However, the situation has not improved for Turkey, as both Russia and Austria have made significant inroads into what should be Turkey's sphere of influence.

Based on the previous rounds of negotiations, it seems that Turkey has been trying to make a truce where Russia vacates Ankara and allows Turkey to retake it, while also trying to make a truce where Austria vacates Constantinople and allows Turkey to retake it. Another part of the plan has been to make a joint plan with Italy where Italy supports Turkey in retaking Constantinople from Austria. Additionally, there has been a non-aggression pact and a willingness to cooperate against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved.

For this round of negotiation, the main goals should be:
1. Reaffirm the need for Russia to vacate Ankara so that Turkey can retake it.
2. Reaffirm the need for Austria to vacate Constantinople so that Turkey can retake it.
3. Continue to seek support from Italy in retaking Constantinople from Austria.
4. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Germany and express a willingness to cooperate against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved.

Based on this reasoning, the plan for this round should be:
1. Send a message to Russia proposing a truce where Russia vacates Ankara and allows Turkey to retake it.
2. Send a message to Austria proposing a truce where Austria vacates Constantinople and allows Turkey to retake it.
3. Send a message to Italy proposing a joint plan where Italy supports Turkey in retaking Constantinople from Austria.
4. Send a message to Germany reaffirming the non-aggression pact and expressing a willingness to cooperate against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved.
5. Update the memory with the new round of negotiations.

[2025-04-15 11:09:37.973]         >> Thought (GERMANY): Based on the current game state and the messages received, it seems that England has captured Holland from Germany in F1906R, which is a significant blow to Germany's strategic position. However, Germany has managed to capture Denmark from Russia. The main goal now should be to secure Germany's position and make strategic decisions for the upcoming build phase where Germany has one build available.

1. **England's message suggests a reaffirmation of the DMZ in the North Sea (NTH) and Baltic Sea (BAL) and proposes a joint action against Russia where England wants Germany to support retaking Denmark if necessary. However, England has just captured Holland from Germany, which makes their intentions a bit suspicious. It seems that England is growing stronger and might be a significant threat.

2. **France's message reaffirms the DMZ in Burgundy (BUR) and suggests that England seems to be growing stronger. France proposes a potential joint action against England if Germany feels threatened by England's expansion. France also asks about Germany's plan for the winter build.

3. **Italy reaffirms the non-aggression pact and is open to future cooperation once Turkey is defeated, especially if there is a need to balance against a growing power such as Russia.

4. **Russia is concerned about Germany's capture of Denmark and wants to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and DMZ in the Baltic Sea and Galicia. However, Russia wants to resolve the issue of Denmark's capture.

5. **Turkey reaffirms the non-aggression pact and expresses a willingness to cooperate against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved. Turkey acknowledges that Russia has a significant presence in the Balkans and has captured Ankara.

Based on the current situation, it seems that England is a growing threat due to its capture of Holland. France seems to be a potential ally against England. Russia is a significant power but seems to be more focused on the south and might be a potential ally against England as well. However, Russia is also a significant power that could be a future threat once Turkey is defeated. Austria and Italy are still engaged with Turkey and might be potential allies against Russia once they resolve their situation with Turkey.

**Plan for this round:**
1. **Reaffirm the DMZ in BUR with France and express a willingness to discuss a joint action against England. Given that France seems to be a potential ally against England, it makes sense to strengthen this alliance.
2. **Reaffirm the DMZ in NTH and BAL with England but make it clear that the capture of Holland is a point of contention. Propose that England should vacate Holland so that Germany can secure it again. If England agrees, Germany could still consider a joint action against Russia.
3. **Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Russia and the DMZ in the Baltic Sea and Galicia. However, make it clear that Germany needs to secure its position against England first. Propose that once Germany secures its borders against England, a joint action against England could be considered.
4. **Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Austria and Italy and express a willingness to cooperate against Russia once they resolve their situation with Turkey.
5. **Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Turkey and express a willingness to cooperate against Russia once Turkey stabilizes its position against Austria.
6. **For the winter build, it makes sense to build a new unit in Berlin (BER) to strengthen Germany's position. A new army could be useful for a potential push towards Warsaw or to defend against any threats from the west.

[2025-04-15 11:11:31.430]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: Turkey is on the brink of being eliminated. The joint attack plan with Austria and Italy should be followed until Turkey is completely out of the game. The plan is for Russia to keep ANK, Austria to take SMY, and Italy to take GRE. England has a strong presence in the north and seems to be a growing threat, so the non-aggression pact should be reaffirmed until Turkey is fully defeated. France seems to be a potential ally against Germany once Turkey is defeated. Germany has been weakened and is now proposing a joint action against England, which could be a strategic opportunity once Turkey is defeated. Turkey's proposal for a truce should be declined. Plan: Reaffirm joint attack plan with Austria and Italy until Turkey is fully defeated. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with England until Turkey is defeated. Reaffirm potential future alliance against Germany with France once Turkey is fully defeated. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ with Germany and express interest in a joint action against England once Turkey is fully defeated. Decline Turkey's truce proposal.

[2025-04-15 11:14:51.739]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Based on the current game state and the overall goal, it seems that Turkey is nearly defeated. The main goal now should be to make sure that once Turkey is fully defeated, the agreed distribution of territories is followed (ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy). However, it seems that Russia has already taken BUL, which was part of the plan for Austria to keep. Thus, a new agreement should be made where Austria should aim to keep CON and GRE while Russia keeps BUL and ANK once Turkey is defeated. Another important part of the plan is to make sure that once Turkey is out, no aggressive moves are made towards each other's core territories. Another important part of the plan is to make sure that once Turkey is out, a potential coalition against Russia might be formed once Turkey is defeated. Thus, it makes sense to reaffirm alliances with Italy and possibly make new alliances with England, France, and Germany against Russia. The main focus should be on making a final push against Turkey and then making sure that the agreed distribution of territories is followed. Another important part is to make sure that the non-aggression pact with Italy is still in place where Austria does not move into VEN or ADR and Italy does not move into TRI or ALB. Thus, the plan for this round should be:
1. Reaffirm the joint attack on Turkey until it is fully defeated.
2. Reaffirm that once Turkey is out, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy.
3. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy where Austria does not move into VEN or ADR and Italy does not move into TRI or ALB.
4. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany and make sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards Austria's core territories (VIE, BUD, TRI).
5. Express interest in a joint action against Russia once Turkey is defeated and make sure that England, France, and Germany are on board for a potential coalition against Russia.

To Germany, acknowledge the recent capture of Holland and propose a truce or a new agreement where we might offer a DMZ in Holland if Germany agrees to a joint action against Russia such as a coordinated attack on Sweden.

Need to make sure that England does not make any aggressive moves against France while potentially continuing a joint action against Germany such as attacking Kiel. Germany might be open to a joint action against England such as retaking Holland. Italy should be kept neutral with a reaffirmed non-aggression pact. Russia and Austria both need a more concrete plan for a future alliance against Germany and Russia respectively once Turkey is fully defeated. Plan: Propose a joint action against Germany to England (attack Kiel), propose a joint action against England to Germany (retake Holland), reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy, make a more concrete plan with Russia for a future alliance against Germany once Turkey is defeated, and make a more solid plan with Austria for a future alliance against Russia once Turkey is defeated.

[2025-04-15 11:19:36.169]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: Turkey is almost defeated with only two centers (SMY and GRE) remaining. The next step should be to make sure that Turkey is completely eliminated. Once Turkey is defeated, the main remaining Turkish centers should be divided such that ANK should go to Russia and SMY should go to Austria. However, once Turkey is fully defeated, the next potential threat might be Austria. It is important to make sure that Austria does not become too powerful or turn against Russia. In the north, England has a strong presence and has captured Holland from Germany, while Germany has captured Denmark from Russia. It might be necessary to make a strategic decision here: either try to retake Denmark or make a deal with Germany to keep the peace in the north while focusing on the south. France seems to be a potential ally against Germany. Plan: 1) Continue joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy until it is fully defeated. 2) Reaffirm non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia with England while expressing concern about Germany's capture of Denmark. 3) Express continued interest in a future alliance against Germany with France. 4) Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Germany while addressing the capture of Denmark.

[2025-04-15 11:23:38.108]         >> Thought (FRANCE): Based on the current game state and the messages received, it seems that the main focus should be on balancing relations with England and Germany while making sure that our borders are secure. England has proposed a joint action against Germany where we could support their hold on Holland (HOL) or make a coordinated attack on Germany's fleet in Helgoland Bight (F HEL) where our F ENG could support their F NTH-HEL. Germany, on the other hand, has proposed a joint action against England where we make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards Germany. Austria has suggested a potential coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Italy has reaffirmed our non-aggression pact and suggested future cooperation once Turkey is defeated. Russia has expressed interest in a future alliance against Germany once Turkey is fully defeated. 

Based on this, here is a plan for this round:
1. To England, reaffirm the DMZ in the English Channel (ENG) and agree to support their hold on Holland (HOL) if they make a move against Germany's fleet in Helgoland Bight (F HEL) where our F ENG could support their F NTH-HEL. However, we need to make sure that England does not make any aggressive moves towards us.
2. To Germany, reaffirm the DMZ in Burgundy (BUR) and make a vague promise that Italy will not make any aggressive moves towards Germany. However, we need to make sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards us either.
3. To Austria, acknowledge their proposal for a potential coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated and express a willingness to make a more concrete plan once Turkey is fully defeated.
4. To Italy, reaffirm our non-aggression pact and express a willingness to discuss future cooperation once Turkey is defeated.
5. To Russia, acknowledge their interest in a future alliance against Germany once Turkey is fully defeated and express a continued interest in such an alliance, but make a more concrete plan once Turkey is fully defeated.
6. Update memory with the new round's proposals and actions.

[2025-04-15 11:24:39.329]         >> Thought (GERMANY): Based on the current game state and the messages received, it seems that England has captured Holland from Germany in F1906R. This makes England a significant threat as they now have a unit in a strategic position close to Germany's home centers. However, England seems open to negotiation and might offer a DMZ in Holland if Germany agrees to a joint action against Russia such as a coordinated attack on Sweden where Germany's F KIE supports F DEN-SWE. France has proposed a joint action against England where France's A BUR could support a German move into Belgium. However, France also wants to reaffirm a DMZ in Burgundy. Italy reaffirms a non-aggression pact and suggests future cooperation once Turkey is defeated. Russia is concerned about Germany's capture of Denmark but wants to reaffirm a non-aggression pact and a DMZ in the Baltic Sea and Galicia. Turkey reaffirms a non-aggression pact and is willing to cooperate against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved.

Based on this, the main strategic priorities for Germany should be:
1. Securing Holland back from England or at least making sure that England does not make any further aggressive moves against Germany.
2. Potentially making a joint action against Russia to capture Sweden and weaken Russia's position in the north.
3. Maintaining a non-aggression pact with France and making sure that France does not make any aggressive moves against Germany.
4. Keeping a non-aggression pact with Austria and Italy until their conflicts with Turkey are resolved.
5. Reaffirming the non-aggression pact with Russia while focusing on the immediate threat from England.

Based on this reasoning, the plan for this round should be:
1. Negotiate with England to either vacate Holland or make a joint action against Russia where England supports Germany in retaking Holland.
2. Negotiate with France for a joint action against England where France supports Germany in retaking Belgium or Holland.
3. Reaffirm non-aggression pacts with Austria, Italy, and Russia while focusing on the immediate threat from England.
4. Update memory with any new agreements or proposals made in this round.

[2025-04-15 11:26:18.648]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: Turkey is nearly defeated and only holds two supply centers (SMY and GRE). The main goal should be to make a final push to eliminate Turkey completely. Austria and Italy are aligned on this plan where ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy once Turkey is defeated. England proposes a joint action against Germany where F NTH could support a Russian move from Denmark to Kiel, but first, we need to retake Denmark. France is open to a future alliance against Germany once Turkey is defeated. Germany proposes a joint action against England where Russia should support Germany in retaking Holland, but Germany might be a next target once Turkey is defeated. Turkey's truce proposal should be rejected. Plan: Reaffirm plans with Austria and Italy for a final push against Turkey. Acknowledge England's proposal but mention that retaking Denmark should be a priority first. Acknowledge France's willingness to make a plan against Germany once Turkey is defeated. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany but be non-committal about a joint action against England until Turkey is fully defeated. Reject Turkey's truce proposal.

France has proposed a DMZ in ENG and is willing to support our hold on HOL or make a coordinated attack on Germany's fleet in Helgoland Bight (HEL) where their F ENG could support our F NTH-HEL. Germany wants us to vacate Holland and is open to a joint action against Russia such as a coordinated attack on Sweden where their F KIE supports F DEN-SWE. Russia wants us to make a joint action against Germany where F NTH could support a potential Russian move from Denmark to Kiel. However, Germany currently holds Denmark (F DEN), so retaking Denmark should be a priority first. Based on this, a possible plan could be: A LON H, F LVP - IRI, F NTH - HEL (supported by F ENG from France), F EDI H, F HOL H.

[2025-04-15 11:38:32.395]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Reasoning: The main goal is to make a final push against Turkey until it is fully defeated. Once Turkey is out, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. It is important to reaffirm non-aggression pacts with Italy and Germany. Additionally, there is a growing interest in a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated, so it makes sense to acknowledge and express interest in such a coalition. Plan: Reaffirm joint attack on Turkey with Italy and Russia, reaffirm non-aggression pacts with Italy and Germany, and express interest in a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated.

[2025-04-15 11:39:29.496]         >> Thought (ENGLAND): Reasoning: France should be asked to maintain the DMZ in the English Channel and support us in holding Holland or attacking Germany's fleet in Helgoland Bight. Germany should be approached with a truce where a DMZ in Holland might be offered if they agree to a joint action against Russia such as a coordinated attack on Sweden. Russia should be asked to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and consider a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Kiel where F NTH could support a potential Russian move from Denmark. Additionally, reaching out to Austria and Italy to form a coalition against Russia might be a good idea once Turkey is fully defeated. Plan: Propose DMZ in ENG to France, propose a truce and joint action against Russia to Germany, reaffirm non-aggression pact and propose joint action against Germany to Russia, and reach out to Austria and Italy for a future coalition against Russia.

[2025-04-15 11:41:35.776]         >> Thought (ITALY): Reasoning: Turkey is nearly defeated with only two units and two supply centers. The alliance with Austria and Russia should be reaffirmed until Turkey is fully defeated. The plan for post-Turkey division should be confirmed again (ANK to Russia, SMY to Austria, GRE to Italy). Non-aggression pacts with France and Germany should be reaffirmed. Since Turkey is close to being defeated, it is important to start discussing a potential coalition against Russia, who has become a dominant power with 8 supply centers. Final Plan: Reaffirm alliance with Austria and Russia until Turkey is defeated, confirm post-Turkey division plan, reaffirm non-aggression pacts with France and Germany, and discuss a coalition against Russia with England.

The joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy should be reaffirmed until Turkey is fully defeated. Once Turkey is defeated, ANK should go to Russia and SMY should go to Austria. In the north, England has a strong presence which could be a threat. Germany captured Denmark from us, so a joint action against Germany might be necessary. France could be a potential ally against Germany once Turkey is resolved.

Reaffirm non-aggression pacts where necessary and express willingness to cooperate against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved. Plan: Propose a truce to Russia for vacating ANK, propose a truce to Austria for vacating CON, seek support from Italy for retaking CON, and reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany.

Once Turkey is out, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. Reaffirm non-aggression pacts where Austria does not move into VEN or ADR and Italy does not move into TRI or ALB. After Turkey is defeated, a potential coalition against Russia should be discussed. Acknowledge England's concern about Russia's growing power and express agreement that a coalition against Russia might be necessary once Turkey is fully defeated. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany and express interest in future cooperation once Turkey is resolved. Politely decline Turkey's request for support against Austria.

[2025-04-15 11:49:00.343]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: Turkey is on the brink of being eliminated with only two units and two supply centers. The joint attack with Austria and Italy should continue until Turkey is fully defeated. Once Turkey is out, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. England suggests a joint action against Germany where England's fleet in NTH could support a potential move from Russia's fleet in Denmark, which is a mistake as Germany holds Denmark. However, Russia should still reaffirm the non-aggression pact and suggest a joint action where Russia's fleet in STP/NC could move to BAL and support an attack on KIE if England makes a move from NTH. Germany suggests a joint action against England where Russia supports Germany in retaking Holland, which seems less feasible for Russia. France did not send a message this round, so it might be worth reaching out to reaffirm a future alliance against Germany once Turkey is resolved. Plan: Reaffirm joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy until Turkey is fully defeated. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with England and suggest a joint action against Germany. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany but be non-committal about a joint action against England until Turkey is out. Decline Turkey's truce proposal. Reach out to France to reaffirm a future alliance against Germany.

[2025-04-15 11:52:45.913]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Reasoning: Turkey is in a very weak position with only two units and two supply centers (SMY and GRE). Russia has a significant presence in the region with units in BUL, ANK, and SEV, and a fleet in the Black Sea (BLA). Austria has a unit in CON and a fleet in the Aegean Sea (AEG), which makes it a direct threat to Turkey's remaining units in GRE and SMY. Germany has expressed a desire to reaffirm a non-aggression pact and is interested in a joint action against Russia once Turkey resolves its situation with Austria. Plan: 1) Acknowledge Germany's message and reaffirm the non-aggression pact. 2) Propose a truce where Austria vacates Constantinople so that Turkey can retake it. 3) Propose a truce where Russia vacates Ankara so that Turkey can retake it. 4) Propose a joint plan where Italy supports Turkey in retaking Constantinople from Austria.

France suggests a joint action where England makes a move on Kiel while France makes a move on Germany's fleet in Helgoland Bight. Germany wants us to vacate Holland, which we should not do. Thus, the plan is: A LON should hold to protect London. F NTH should move to Helgoland Bight (F NTH - HEL) to directly attack Germany's fleet there. F EDI should move to the North Sea (F EDI - NTH) to fill the gap left by F NTH. F HOL should move to Kiel (F HOL - KIE) to attack Germany's fleet there. F IRI should hold the Irish Sea (F IRI H) to protect against any potential moves from France or to support future actions.

France proposes a joint action against England where Germany makes a move on Holland while France makes a move on England's fleet in the North Sea. Russia wants to focus on Turkey first and then suggests a joint action against England. Austria and Turkey both suggest a joint action against Russia once their conflicts are resolved. Based on this, a plan could be: F DEN - SWE (if England supports it, otherwise hold), A MUN H (hold a central defensive position), F HEL - HOL (try to recapture Holland), F KIE S F HEL - HOL (support the move of F HEL to Holland).

A APU should also hold to defend against any potential threats from France or other powers.

[2025-04-15 12:02:12.921]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Based on the current game state and the overall goal, it seems that the main focus should be on finalizing the joint attack on Turkey until it is fully defeated. Once Turkey is out, the plan is for ANK to go to Russia, SMY to go to Austria, and GRE to go to Italy. However, it seems that Turkey still holds SMY and GRE. The next step should be to make a final push against Turkey to capture these centers. Additionally, it seems that a coalition against Russia might be a good idea once Turkey is defeated, as Russia has grown quite powerful. Thus, it makes sense to reaffirm alliances with Italy and possibly Germany, England, and France for a future coalition against Russia. However, the immediate priority should be to make a final push against Turkey.

1. Reaffirm the joint attack plan with Italy and Russia until Turkey is fully defeated.
2. Once Turkey is out, make sure that ANK goes to Russia, SMY goes to Austria, and GRE goes to Italy.
3. Reaffirm non-aggression pacts where Austria does not move into VEN or ADR and Italy does not move into TRI or ALB.
4. Discuss a potential coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated with Germany, England, and France.
5. Make sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards Austria's core territories (VIE, BUD, TRI).

Based on this reasoning, I need to send messages to Italy, Russia, Germany, England, and France.

[2025-04-15 12:03:02.985]         >> Thought (ENGLAND): Reasoning: The current game state shows that Russia is a dominant power with a significant presence in the east. It is important to maintain a DMZ in the English Channel with France to avoid any conflicts there. Germany seems to be a potential ally against Russia, so a joint action against Russia might be a good strategy. A coalition with Austria and Italy could also help in balancing the power against Russia. Plan: Propose a DMZ in the English Channel to France, a joint action against Germany where France supports us in holding Holland or attacking Germany's fleet in Helgoland Bight. Propose a truce with Germany where a DMZ in Holland might be offered if Germany agrees to a joint action against Russia such as a coordinated attack on Sweden. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Russia and propose a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Kiel where F NTH could support a potential Russian move from Denmark. Reach out to Austria and Italy for a future coalition against Russia.

[2025-04-15 12:04:19.283]         >> Thought (FRANCE): Reasoning: England has gained Holland and now has 6 supply centers. Germany has been weakened to 4 supply centers. Russia is the most powerful with 8 supply centers. France should reaffirm DMZ in ENG with England and BUR with Germany. Propose joint actions against Germany with England (e.g., attack on Kiel) and against England with Germany (e.g., retake Holland). Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy and make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards France. Acknowledge Russia's power and reaffirm a future alliance against Germany once Turkey is defeated. Reaffirm a future alliance against Russia with Austria once Turkey is defeated. Plan: Propose joint action against Germany to England (attack Kiel), propose joint action against England to Germany (retake Holland), reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy, make a more concrete plan with Russia for a future alliance against Germany once Turkey is defeated, and make a more solid plan with Austria for a future alliance against Russia once Turkey is defeated.

[2025-04-15 12:05:52.908]         >> Thought (ITALY): Reasoning: Turkey is almost defeated with only two supply centers (SMY and GRE) and a dislodged unit in SMY. The plan was that once Turkey is defeated, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. Russia has become a significant power with 8 supply centers, making it a potential future threat. England has shown interest in forming a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Plan: Reaffirm the alliance with Austria and Russia until Turkey is fully defeated. Make sure that once Turkey is defeated, GRE should go to Italy as previously agreed upon. Start discussing a potential coalition against Russia with England and possibly France and Germany.

Once Turkey is out, the plan is for Russia to keep Ankara while Austria takes Smyrna and Italy takes Greece. Another important part of the plan has been a non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia with England. However, Germany has captured Denmark from Russia in F1906R, so a future alliance against Germany might be necessary. Thus, the plan should be to reaffirm the joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy until it is fully defeated. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and division of Scandinavia with England while suggesting a joint action against Germany once Turkey is out. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Germany while being non-committal about a joint action against England until Turkey is out.

[2025-04-15 12:07:27.571]         >> Thought (TURKEY): Based on the current game state and the overall goal, Turkey needs to secure the Black Sea and aim for the Balkans (Bul, Gre, Ser, Rum). However, the current situation shows that Turkey only has two units (A GRE and *A SMY) and two supply centers (SMY and GRE). The main goal should be to retake lost territories such as Smyrna and possibly Constantinople from Austria and Ankara from Russia. 

1. **Analyze the current game state:**
   - Turkey has units in Greece and Smyrna (which is a supply center).
   - Austria has units in Vienna, Trieste, Aegean Sea, Serbia, and Smyrna (which seems to be a mistake because the unit in Smyrna should be under Turkey's control, but it seems like a unit is mistakenly listed here; it should be verified that Austria has a unit in Smyrna which seems incorrect).
   - Russia has a significant presence in the region with units in Galicia, Black Sea, Moscow, Bulgaria, St. Petersburg (North Coast), Sevastopol, Ankara, and Warsaw. Russia has a strong hold on the Balkans and Black Sea region.
   - Italy has units in Venice, Apulia, and Ionian Sea.
   - Germany has units in Munich, Kiel, Sweden, and Holland (which is a shared unit with England).
   - England has units in London, Edinburgh, Irish Sea, Helgoland Bight, and Holland (which is a shared unit with Germany).
   - France has units in Paris, Marseilles, Mid-Atlantic Ocean, English Channel, and Ruhr.

2. **Communication strategy:**
   - **Russia:** Given that Russia has a unit in Ankara and a strong presence in the Black Sea and Balkans, it is crucial to negotiate a truce where Russia vacates Ankara and allows Turkey to retake it. Reaffirming a non-aggression pact and a DMZ in the Black Sea could be a part of this negotiation.
   - **Austria:** Similarly, Austria has a unit in Smyrna (which seems to be a mistake in the unit listing, but it seems that Austria has a unit in Constantinople which should be retaken by Turkey). A truce where Austria vacates Constantinople and allows Turkey to retake it should be proposed. A new agreement where Turkey aims for Greece and Constantinople while Austria focuses on defending against Russia could be a part of this negotiation.
   - **Italy:** Propose a joint plan where Italy supports Turkey in retaking Constantinople from Austria. Italy has a unit in the Ionian Sea which could be used to support Turkish moves in the Balkans.
   - **Germany:** Acknowledging Germany's message and reaffirming a non-aggression pact could be useful. Expressing a willingness to cooperate against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved could be a part of this negotiation.

3. **Final Plan for this round:**
   - Send a message to Russia proposing a truce where Russia vacates Ankara and allows Turkey to retake it. Reaffirm a non-aggression pact and a DMZ in the Black Sea.
   - Send a message to Austria proposing a truce where Austria vacates Constantinople and allows Turkey to retake it. Propose a new agreement where Turkey aims for Greece and Constantinople while Austria focuses on defending against Russia.
   - Send a message to Italy proposing a joint plan where Italy supports Turkey in retaking Constantinople from Austria.
   - Send a message to Germany acknowledging their message and reaffirming a non-aggression pact. Express a willingness to cooperate against Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved.
   - Update memory with the new proposals made in this round.

A coalition against Russia seems like a logical next step once Turkey is defeated. However, until then, it makes sense to keep a good relationship with Russia while focusing on Germany. Plan: 1) To Austria, acknowledge the need for a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. 2) To France, reaffirm the DMZ in the English Channel and propose a joint action against Germany such as attacking Kiel. 3) To Germany, acknowledge the need for a joint action against Russia but make it clear that vacating Holland is not an option. Propose a joint action against Russia where we support Germany in retaking Denmark if Germany agrees to a temporary truce regarding Holland. 4) To Italy, acknowledge the need for a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. 5) To Russia, reaffirm the non-aggression pact and express interest in a joint action against Germany once Turkey is out.

The joint attack plan with Austria and Italy should be continued until Turkey is completely eliminated. Once Turkey is out, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. England proposes a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Kiel where F STP/NC could move to BAL and support an attack on KIE if England makes a move from NTH. France proposes a future alliance against Germany once Turkey is defeated. Germany proposes a joint action against England where Russia supports Germany in retaking Holland. However, Russia should be cautious here because Germany has already captured Denmark from Russia previously. Turkey proposes a truce where Russia vacates Ankara and allows Turkey to retake it, which should be declined. Plan: Reaffirm joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy until Turkey is fully defeated. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and joint action against Germany with England and France once Turkey is out. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Germany while being non-committal about a joint action against England until Turkey is out. Decline Turkey's truce proposal.

Retreating to Belgium (BEL) seems strategic as it keeps the fleet close to Holland and might be supported by France in future actions against Germany.

[2025-04-15 12:27:46.798]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Reasoning: Turkey still holds one supply center (GRE) and has two units (A GRE and A ARM). The plan should be to continue the joint attack until Turkey is completely defeated. Once Turkey is out, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. Another important part of the plan is a potential coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. This has been discussed with England, France, and Germany. For the build, an army in Vienna (A VIE) seems like a strategic choice to strengthen the defense of core territories or make a move towards Galicia (GAL) if a future conflict with Russia is anticipated. Final Plan: Propose to Italy and Russia to make a final push against Turkey. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy. Discuss coalition against Russia with England, France, and Germany. Plan to build an army in Vienna (A VIE).

[2025-04-15 12:28:49.570]         >> Thought (ENGLAND): Reasoning: Given the current game state, England needs to make strategic negotiations. For France, reaffirm the DMZ in the English Channel and propose a joint action against Germany where France supports England in retaking Holland or attacking Kiel. For Germany, propose a joint action against Russia where England supports Germany in retaking Denmark if Germany agrees to a truce regarding Holland. For Russia, reaffirm the non-aggression pact and propose a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Kiel where F NTH could support a potential Russian move from Denmark. For Austria and Italy, propose a future coalition against Russia once Turkey is fully defeated. Update memory with the new round's proposals.

[2025-04-15 12:29:35.960]         >> Thought (FRANCE): Reasoning: France needs to balance relations with England and Germany. England lost Holland to Germany in the last round, so it might be a good time to reaffirm the DMZ in the English Channel and propose a joint action against Germany such as retaking Holland or attacking Kiel. Germany has one build available and has recaptured Holland, so it might be a good time to reaffirm the DMZ in Burgundy and propose a joint action against England such as attacking Belgium. Italy should be approached to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and discuss a future coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Russia needs to disband a unit and might be open to a more concrete plan for a future alliance against Germany. Austria has one build available and should be approached to make a more solid plan for a future coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Final Plan: Propose joint action against Germany to England, propose joint action against England to Germany, reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy and discuss a future coalition against Russia, make a more concrete plan with Russia for a future alliance against Germany, and make a more solid plan with Austria for a future coalition against Russia.

[2025-04-15 12:30:47.640]         >> Thought (GERMANY): Reasoning: Germany has one build available and should consider building a fleet in Berlin to strengthen the Baltic Sea position. The main threats are England and Russia. England has a fleet in HEL which is a threat to Holland and Kiel. France has an army in Ruh which is a threat to MUN and KIE. Russia has a growing power with 7 centers. Plan: Propose a joint action plan against Russia where England vacates Belgium and makes a joint action plan against Russia. Reaffirm the DMZ in Burgundy with France. Make a joint action plan against Russia with Austria now that Austria seems to be in a good position after capturing Smyrna from Turkey. Make a joint action plan against France or Russia with Italy once Italy resolves its situation with Turkey. Make a joint action plan against Russia with Turkey once Turkey resolves its situation with Austria.

[2025-04-15 12:31:47.845]         >> Thought (ITALY): Reasoning: Turkey is nearly defeated with only one supply center (GRE) and two units (A GRE and A ARM). The alliance with Austria and Russia should be reaffirmed until Turkey is completely defeated. Once Turkey is out, GRE should go to Italy as previously agreed. Additionally, Italy should aim for Tunis (TUN) which requires a fleet in ION. Given Russia's dominant position (7 centers and 8 units), it makes sense to start discussing a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Plan: Reaffirm alliance with Austria and Russia until Turkey is defeated, make sure GRE goes to Italy once Turkey is out, reaffirm non-aggression pacts with France and Germany, and discuss a potential coalition against Russia with England, France, and Germany.

[2025-04-15 12:32:44.417]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: Need to disband one unit. F BLA seems less important once Turkey is fully defeated. Germany is a growing threat in the north, so a joint action with England and France against Germany seems necessary. Austria should be kept as an ally until Turkey is fully defeated. Plan: 1) Disband F BLA. 2) Reaffirm joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy until Turkey is fully defeated. 3) Propose a joint action against Germany with England and France. 4) Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Germany.

The main goal should be to make a deal with Austria or Russia to retake lost centers such as Smyrna (SMY) and Ankara (ANK). Another option is to make a deal with Italy to support Turkey in retaking Constantinople (CON) or Smyrna (SMY) from Austria. Plan: Propose a truce to Austria where they vacate Smyrna and allow Turkey to retake it. Propose a truce to Russia where they vacate Ankara and allow Turkey to retake it. Propose a joint plan to Italy where they support Turkey in retaking Constantinople or Smyrna from Austria. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany and express willingness to cooperate against a common enemy such as Russia once the situation with Austria is resolved.

The main goal should be to make a final push to eliminate Turkey from the game. Once Turkey is out, the distribution of their former territories should be as previously agreed upon: ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. Russia is currently the most powerful player with 7 supply centers and 8 units. Once Turkey is defeated, a coalition against Russia seems like a logical next step. England, France, and Germany are all proposing a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Plan: Acknowledge proposals from England, France, and Germany for a coalition against Russia once Turkey is fully defeated. Reaffirm the plan with Italy and Russia for a final push against Turkey until it is fully defeated and the distribution of Turkey's remaining centers once Turkey is out.

However, vacating Belgium would make us lose a supply center. France is proposing a joint action against Germany to retake Holland or attack Kiel. Russia is proposing a joint action against Germany where we make a move from NTH to support an attack on Kiel while Russia makes a move from STP/NC to BAL. However, we need to make sure that no single power becomes too dominant. Plan: Propose a joint action against Germany with France where France supports us in retaking Holland.

Propose a joint action against Germany with Russia where we make a move from Helgoland Bight to Kiel while Russia makes a move from St. Petersburg to the Baltic Sea and then supports the attack on Kiel.

Given that Russia has 7 supply centers and 8 units, it makes sense that Germany sees Russia as a growing threat.

The main threat now seems to be Russia, which has the most supply centers (7) and units (7). The plan was that once Turkey is defeated, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. However, a coalition against Russia seems necessary. Plan: Reaffirm the plan with Italy and Russia for the final push against Turkey and discuss a coalition against Russia with Germany, England, and France.

[2025-04-15 12:53:11.604]         >> Thought (ENGLAND): Reasoning: Germany has recaptured Holland and captured Sweden from Russia, making them a significant threat. A joint action with France against Germany might be a priority. However, Russia still holds a significant number of supply centers and units, so a coalition against Russia might also be strategic. Plan: Propose a joint action against Germany to France where France supports England in retaking Holland or attacking Kiel. Propose a joint action against Russia to Germany where England supports Germany in holding Sweden if Germany agrees to a truce regarding Holland. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Russia and propose a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Kiel. Propose a future coalition against Russia to Austria and Italy once Turkey is fully defeated.

The main goal should be to make a final push to eliminate Turkey completely. Austria has grown significantly and now has six supply centers. Germany has captured Sweden from Russia, which poses a threat to Russia's northern flank. England has lost Holland to Germany and might be interested in a joint action against Germany. France could be a valuable ally against Germany once Turkey is resolved. Plan: Propose a final joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy where A ANK should move to GRE supported by F BLA and A SEV should support A ANK to GRE. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and joint action against Germany with England where F STP/NC could move to BAL and support an attack on KIE if England makes a move from NTH. Express continued interest in a future alliance against Germany with France once Turkey is resolved. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Germany while addressing the need for Germany to vacate Sweden or face a joint action from Russia and England.

The main threats are Austria (which has units in Smyrna and a fleet in the Aegean Sea) and Russia (which has a fleet in the Black Sea, an army in Bulgaria, and an army in Ankara). The goal should be to negotiate a truce with Austria and Russia to stabilize the situation and possibly retake some lost centers such as Smyrna or Ankara. Another potential ally could be Germany, which seems to be in a strong position and has a history of being a potential ally against Russia. Italy could also be a potential ally against Austria. Plan: Propose a truce to Austria where they vacate Smyrna and allow Turkey to retake it. Propose a truce to Russia where they vacate Ankara and allow Turkey to retake it. Seek support from Germany against Russia and from Italy against Austria. Update memory with the new proposals.

The plan has been that once Turkey is defeated, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. Given that Russia is the most powerful player with 7 supply centers, there is a growing consensus among other powers (Austria, England, France, and Germany) that a coalition against Russia should be formed once Turkey is defeated. Thus, the main goal now is to make a final push against Turkey while preparing for a coalition against Russia. Plan: Reaffirm the alliance with Austria and Russia until Turkey is defeated, agree on the post-Turkey division plan, and express willingness to discuss a coalition against Russia once Turkey is out. Reaffirm non-aggression pacts with France and Germany. Politely decline Turkey's proposal for a joint plan against Austria.

[2025-04-15 13:13:50.913]       - Framework: Activating AUSTRIA (LLMAgent)
[2025-04-15 13:15:08.155]       - Framework: Processing 12 actions for AUSTRIA...
[2025-04-15 13:15:08.157]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Based on the current game state and the overall goal, it seems that the main focus should be on finalizing the defeat of Turkey and making plans for a potential coalition against Russia once Turkey is fully defeated. The current game state shows that Austria has units in VIE, TRI, AEG, SMY, BUD, and GRE. Turkey only has a dislodged unit in GRE. The supply centers show that Austria has BUD, TRI, VIE, CON, SER, and SMY, while Turkey only has GRE. It seems that Turkey is on the brink of being fully defeated.

1. **Turkey's Situation**: Turkey only has a dislodged unit in GRE and a single supply center (GRE). The main priority should be to make sure that Turkey is completely eliminated from the game. This means that we need to make sure that the unit in GRE is disbanded and that Austria captures GRE.

2. **Alliance with Italy and Russia**: The previous rounds have shown a strong alliance with Italy and Russia against Turkey. However, once Turkey is defeated, the plan is to form a coalition against Russia. Thus, it is important to make sure that Italy is on board with this plan. The plan previously agreed upon was that once Turkey is defeated, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. However, it seems that Austria currently holds SMY and GRE should be captured next.

3. **Non-Aggression Pact with Germany**: A non-aggression pact with Germany has been reaffirmed multiple times. It seems that Germany is also part of the potential coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Thus, it is important to make sure that Germany is also on board with the plan to act against Russia.

4. **Messages from England and France**: Both England and France have proposed a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. It seems that there is a broad consensus among multiple powers (including Austria, Italy, Germany, England, and France) to act against Russia once Turkey is out of the picture.

Based on this reasoning, the plan for this round should be:

- **Communicate with Italy**: Reaffirm the plan that once Turkey is fully defeated, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. However, since Austria currently holds SMY and needs to make sure that GRE is captured (which should be given to Italy), it makes sense to make a move to ensure that Italy captures GRE. However, it seems that Austria should make a move to capture GRE itself if necessary and then make a transfer agreement with Italy if needed.

- **Communicate with Russia**: Reaffirm the plan that once Turkey is fully defeated, ANK should go to Russia and SMY should go to Austria. However, it seems that Austria already holds SMY, so the main focus should be on making sure that Russia does not make any aggressive moves towards Austria's core territories once Turkey is out.

- **Communicate with Germany, England, and France**: Reaffirm the plan for a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Make sure that all parties are on board and that there is a coordinated plan for the next moves against Russia.

- **Update Memory**: Record any new agreements or plans made in this round.

[2025-04-15 13:16:18.471]         >> Thought (ENGLAND): Reasoning: France has a fleet in the English Channel (F ENG), so it's important to reaffirm the DMZ in ENG to prevent any potential conflicts. Germany has a fleet in Kiel (F KIE) and another in Sweden (F SWE), making them a significant threat in the North Sea and Baltic Sea regions. Russia has lost Sweden to Germany and might be interested in retaking it. Austria has captured Smyrna from Turkey, so Turkey seems to be on the brink of elimination. Plan: (1) Reaffirm DMZ in ENG with France and propose a joint action against Germany where France supports us in retaking Holland or attacking Kiel. (2) Propose a joint action against Russia where we support Germany in holding Sweden if they agree to a truce regarding Holland. (3) Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Russia and propose a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Kiel where F NTH could support a potential Russian move from Denmark. (4) Propose a future coalition against Russia to Austria and Italy once Turkey is fully defeated.

[2025-04-15 13:17:08.852]         >> Thought (FRANCE): Reasoning: France needs to maintain a balance between England and Germany while making sure that our borders are secure. We need to reaffirm the DMZ in ENG with England and BUR with Germany. Propose a joint action against Germany with England such as retaking Holland (HOL) or attacking Kiel (KIE). Simultaneously, propose a joint action against England with Germany such as retaking Belgium (BEL) or making a coordinated attack on England's units in the North Sea (NTH) or Holland (HOL). Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Italy and discuss a future coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Make a well-coordinated plan with Russia for a future alliance against Germany once Turkey is fully defeated. Make a solid plan with Austria for a future coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Final Plan: Propose joint action against Germany to England, propose joint action against England to Germany, reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy, make a well-coordinated plan with Russia for a future alliance against Germany, and make a solid plan with Austria for a future coalition against Russia.

France has a unit in Ruh, which borders MUN and KIE. Austria has made significant gains against Turkey and now has 6 centers and 6 units. Italy has only 3 centers and 3 units. Turkey is on the brink of elimination with only one supply center. Plan: Propose a joint action against Russia where England vacates Holland so that Germany can secure it again. Reaffirm the DMZ in NTH and BAL. Reaffirm the DMZ in BUR with France and make sure that France makes a move against Russia or makes sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards Germany. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Russia until Turkey is defeated. Propose a joint action against England once Germany secures its borders against England. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact and no aggressive moves towards Austria's core territories (VIE, BUD, TRI) and propose joint action against Russia once Turkey is defeated.

Once Turkey is out, a coalition against Russia seems logical as Russia is the strongest power on the board. Austria is the second strongest power in the region, so it makes sense to keep a close eye on Austria's actions. Italy should aim to secure GRE as agreed previously and make a move to secure TUN if possible. Maintain non-aggression pacts with France and Germany. Plan: Reaffirm plans with Austria and Russia until Turkey is defeated. Agree to a coalition against Russia once Turkey is out. Reaffirm non-aggression pacts with France and Germany.

[2025-04-15 13:41:04.611]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Based on the current game state and the overall goal, it seems that the main focus should be on finalizing the defeat of Turkey and preparing for a potential coalition against Russia once Turkey is fully defeated. However, Turkey has been eliminated from the game as there are no Turkish units listed in the current game state. Thus, the next step should be to make sure that the agreed-upon distribution of territories is respected (ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy). However, it seems that Austria currently holds GRE and SMY while Russia holds ANK. Thus, it seems that the only part of the agreement that needs to be fulfilled is for Austria to hand over GRE to Italy. However, it seems that Italy has not made any aggressive moves towards Austria yet, so it might be a good idea to make a diplomatic move here.

Another important part of the plan is to make a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Given that Turkey is now out of the game, it makes sense to start making concrete plans for a coalition against Russia. Based on previous communications, England, France, and Germany have all expressed interest in a coalition against Russia. Thus, it makes sense to reach out to these powers to make a solid plan for a joint action against Russia.

Based on this reasoning, the plan for this round should be:
1. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Italy and make a plan to hand over GRE to Italy if that was the agreed-upon plan.
2. Reach out to England, France, and Germany to make a solid plan for a coalition against Russia.
3. Make sure that the non-aggression pact with Germany is still in place and that there are no aggressive moves from Germany towards Austria's core territories (VIE, BUD, TRI).
4. Update memory to reflect the new round and any new agreements made.

[2025-04-15 13:42:00.759]         >> Thought (ENGLAND): Reasoning: England needs to make strategic decisions on key areas such as Holland, Belgium, and the English Channel. Reaffirm the DMZ in the English Channel with France and propose a joint action against Germany such as retaking Holland or attacking Kiel. Propose a joint action against Russia where Germany focuses on Sweden while England holds Holland. Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Russia and propose a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Kiel where F NTH could support a potential Russian move from Denmark. Reaffirm the future coalition against Russia with Austria and Italy once Turkey is fully defeated. Final Plan: Propose joint actions against Germany to France and Russia, propose a joint action against Russia to Germany, and reaffirm the coalition against Russia with Austria and Italy.

Propose a joint action against Germany to England such as attacking Kiel (KIE) or Berlin (BER). Propose a joint action against England to Germany such as attacking Holland (HOL). Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy and discuss a future coalition against Russia once Turkey is fully defeated. Make a well-coordinated plan with Russia for a future alliance against Germany once Turkey is fully defeated. Make a solid plan with Austria for a future coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Memory: Update memory with the new round's proposals.

A coalition against Russia seems to be a common theme in previous negotiations. Plan: Propose to England that they vacate Belgium so that Germany can secure it and make a joint action against Russia. Reaffirm DMZ in NTH and BAL. To France, reaffirm DMZ in BUR and propose a joint action against England where France makes sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards Germany. To Russia, reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia until Turkey is defeated. To Austria, reaffirm non-aggression pact and propose a joint action against Russia once Turkey is defeated. To Italy, reaffirm non-aggression pact and propose a joint action against Russia once Turkey is defeated. To Turkey, reaffirm non-aggression pact and express interest in future joint action against Russia once Turkey resolves its situation with Austria.

[2025-04-15 13:44:48.984]         >> Thought (ITALY): Reasoning: Turkey is almost defeated with only one supply center (GRE) remaining. The plan was for Italy to take GRE once Turkey is defeated. However, Austria currently has a unit in GRE (A GRE). Need to negotiate with Austria to make sure that they vacate GRE so that Italy can take it. Additionally, Russia is the most powerful power now, so it makes sense to continue discussions with England, France, and Germany about forming a coalition against Russia once Turkey is completely defeated. Plan: 1) Request Austria to vacate GRE so that Italy can take it. 2) Reaffirm alliance with Russia until Turkey is defeated. 3) Continue discussions with England, France, and Germany about a coalition against Russia.

[2025-04-15 13:46:15.094]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: Turkey is almost defeated with only one unit in GRE and one supply center (GRE). The main goal should be to make a final push to eliminate Turkey completely. Austria has been a key ally against Turkey but might become a rival once Turkey is out. England has been a non-aggression partner, but Germany has captured Sweden from us. France has been a potential ally against Germany. Germany has been a non-aggression partner but has captured Sweden. Italy has been part of the joint attack on Turkey. Plan: Propose a final joint attack on Turkey with Austria and Italy where A ANK should move to GRE supported by F BLA and A SEV should support A ANK to GRE. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and joint action against Germany with England where F STP/NC could move to BAL and support an attack on KIE if England makes a move from NTH. Express continued interest in a future alliance against Germany with France once Turkey is resolved. Address Germany's capture of Sweden and demand that Germany vacates Sweden or face a joint action from Russia and England. Reaffirm the joint attack on Turkey until it is fully defeated with Italy and discuss a potential alliance against another power such as Austria or Germany once Turkey is out.

Italy wants a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Russia demands that Germany vacate Sweden or face a joint action from Russia and England. Turkey needs help to put pressure on Russia. Plan: Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Austria and agree to a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Propose that England vacates Holland so that Germany can retake it and then focus on a joint action against Russia. Agree with France's plan to retake Holland from England. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy and agree to a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Reject Russia's demand to vacate Sweden and reaffirm the non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia until Turkey is defeated. Express sympathy for Turkey's situation and make it clear that Germany needs to secure its borders first.

The agreement was that ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy once Turkey is fully defeated. It makes sense to reaffirm non-aggression pacts with Austria once Turkey is out. A joint action against Germany with England and France seems like a good plan given that Germany has captured Sweden from Russia. Germany's proposal for a joint action against England should be declined until Turkey is fully defeated. Plan: Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Austria once Turkey is out, join a joint action against Germany with England and France, make sure Italy gets GRE once Turkey is fully defeated, and decline Turkey's truce proposal.

[2025-04-15 14:01:24.764]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Based on the current game state and the history of negotiations, it seems that the main focus should be on finalizing the defeat of Turkey and preparing for a potential coalition against Russia once Turkey is fully defeated. The main goal is to make sure that once Turkey is out, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. However, it seems that Turkey has been eliminated from the game (since there are no Turkish units listed in the current game state and Turkey only has one supply center, which is Greece). Thus, the next step should be to make sure that the agreed distribution of territories is respected and that a coalition against Russia is formed.

1. **Verify Turkey's status and make sure that the agreed distribution of territories (ANK to Russia, SMY to Austria, and GRE to Italy) is respected. However, it seems that Austria currently holds Smyrna (SMY) and Greece (GRE), while Russia holds Ankara (ANK) and Bulgaria (BUL). Thus, it seems that the part of the plan where GRE should go to Italy has not been fulfilled yet.

2. **Reaffirm non-aggression pacts with Italy and Germany. For Italy, make sure that Austria does not move into VEN or ADR and Italy does not move into TRI or ALB. For Germany, reaffirm the non-aggression pact and make sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves towards Austria's core territories (VIE, BUD, TRI).

3. **Communicate with England, France, and Germany about forming a coalition against Russia. Since Turkey seems to be effectively out of the game, it is now time to make a plan against Russia, who has a significant number of units and supply centers (7 centers).

4. **Update memory to reflect the current state and the next steps.

Based on this reasoning, the plan for this round should be:
- Send a message to Italy to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and discuss the need to transfer Greece (GRE) to Italy as previously agreed upon once Turkey is defeated. Also, discuss the need for a plan against Russia.
- Send a message to Russia to make sure that no aggressive moves are made towards each other's core territories now that Turkey is defeated. Reaffirm that ANK should go to Russia and SMY should go to Austria.
- Send a message to Germany to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and discuss a joint action against Russia.
- Send a message to England and France to express agreement on forming a coalition against Russia.
- Update memory to reflect the current round's negotiations and plans.

France should be approached to reaffirm the DMZ in ENG and propose a joint action against Germany. Germany should be approached for a joint action against Russia where we support them in holding Sweden while they agree to a DMZ in NTH and BAL. Russia should be approached for a joint action against Germany where we support them in retaking Sweden if they agree to a non-aggression pact and a DMZ in NTH and BAL. Austria and Italy should be approached for a specific plan for a coalition against Russia. Plan: Propose DMZ in ENG to France and joint action against Germany.

[2025-04-15 14:03:24.689]         >> Thought (FRANCE): Reasoning: Russia is the most powerful player with 7 centers. A coalition against Russia might be a strategic move.

Plan: Reaffirm DMZ in ENG with England and propose a joint action against Germany such as retaking Holland (HOL) or attacking Kiel (KIE). Reaffirm DMZ in BUR with Germany and make sure that Italy does not make any aggressive moves towards Germany. Propose a joint action against England such as retaking Belgium (BEL) if that makes sense given the current unit positions. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy and discuss a future coalition against Russia once Turkey is fully defeated. Acknowledge Russia's proposal for a joint action against Germany and express willingness to make a well-coordinated plan such as making a move from Ruh (RUH) if a well-coordinated plan is made. Propose a joint action against Russia to Austria once Turkey is fully defeated.

[2025-04-15 14:04:44.943]         >> Thought (GERMANY): Reasoning: England has a dislodged fleet in Holland that needs to retreat. It makes sense to encourage England to disband that fleet or retreat it to HEL if they agree to vacate Belgium. France should be reassured about the DMZ in Burgundy and a joint action against England should be proposed. Russia should be reminded of the non-aggression pact and DMZ in the Baltic Sea and Galicia, and a joint action against England should be discussed. Austria should be approached for a joint action against Russia now that Turkey is almost defeated. Italy should also be approached for a joint action against Russia once Turkey is fully defeated. Turkey should be reassured of the non-aggression pact, although their situation is dire. Final Plan: Propose that England disbands F HOL or retreats to HEL if they vacate Belgium. Reaffirm DMZ in BUR with France and propose a joint action against England. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Russia and propose a joint action against England. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Austria and propose a joint action against Russia. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy and propose a joint action against Russia.

However, Austria currently holds a unit in GRE (A GRE), so I need to request Austria to vacate GRE so that Italy can take it. Additionally, Russia is the most powerful player now, so it makes sense to continue discussions with England, France, and Germany about a potential coalition against Russia once Turkey is completely defeated. Plan: Request Austria to vacate GRE so that Italy can take it. Reaffirm alliance with Russia until Turkey is defeated. Continue discussions with England, France, and Germany about a coalition against Russia once Turkey is defeated. Politely decline any new proposals from Turkey.

The main goal now should be to make sure that Turkey is fully eliminated and that any remaining Turkish centers are distributed among the allies (Russia, Austria, and Italy). Another important part of the plan is to address the situation in the north where Germany has captured Sweden from Russia. Thus, a joint action against Germany might be a good next step once Turkey is fully defeated. Plan: 1) Reaffirm the joint action against Germany with England and France once Turkey is fully defeated. 2) Make a final push to make sure that Turkey is completely out of the game. 3) Address the issue of Germany holding Sweden and plan a joint action with England to retake it if necessary.

[2025-04-15 14:11:36.620]         >> Thought (GERMANY): Reasoning: Russia is the largest power with 7 centers and a strong military presence. Turkey is almost defeated. Austria proposes a joint action against Russia and reaffirms a non-aggression pact for their core territories (VIE, BUD, TRI). England proposes a DMZ in NTH and BAL and a joint action against Russia while supporting Germany in holding Sweden. France proposes a DMZ in BUR and a joint action to retake Belgium from England. Italy proposes a coalition against Russia once Turkey is completely defeated. Russia demands that Germany vacate Sweden or face a joint action from Russia and England. Plan: Reaffirm non-aggression pacts where necessary, agree to a DMZ in NTH and BAL with England, reaffirm DMZ in BUR with France, and agree to a joint action against Russia with Austria, France, and Italy once Turkey is completely defeated. Politely decline Russia's demand to vacate Sweden.

However, Austria currently holds both SMY and GRE. It is important to make sure that Austria vacates GRE so that Italy can take it. Additionally, once Turkey is fully defeated, a coalition against Russia should be formed. Plan: 1) Request Austria to vacate GRE so that Italy can take it. 2) Reaffirm non-aggression pacts with Austria, France, and Germany. 3) Agree to make a plan against Russia once Turkey is fully defeated. 4) Discuss a coalition plan against Russia with England, France, and Germany.

Additionally, reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Germany and make a plan for a joint action against Russia once Turkey stabilizes its situation with Austria. Another part of the plan should be to make a last-ditch effort to make Italy reconsider their alliance with Austria and Russia.

A joint action against Germany with France could help us retake Holland and secure our position in the North Sea. A joint action against Russia with Germany could help us hold Sweden and secure our position in Scandinavia. However, a non-aggression pact with Russia could also be beneficial if we need to focus on Germany. Thus, a balanced approach might be to build two fleets (F LON and F LVP) to strengthen our naval presence and support actions in the North Sea and the English Channel. Propose a DMZ in the English Channel to France and a joint action against Germany where France supports us in retaking Holland. Propose a joint action against Russia to Germany where we support them in holding Sweden while Germany agrees to a DMZ in NTH and BAL. Propose a joint action against Germany to Russia where we support them in retaking Sweden if Russia agrees to a non-aggression pact and a DMZ in NTH and BAL.

[2025-04-15 14:42:11.184]         >> Thought (FRANCE): Reasoning: England has captured KIE from Germany and has two builds available, making them a significant power. Germany has one build available and might be looking to recover. Russia has a strong position in the east. Plan: Reaffirm DMZ in ENG with England and propose a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on HOL. Reaffirm DMZ in BUR with Germany and propose a joint action against England such as a coordinated attack on KIE. Propose a joint action against Germany with Russia such as a coordinated attack on BER. Propose a joint action against Russia with Austria such as a coordinated attack on BUL. Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy and propose a joint action against Austria such as a coordinated attack on TRI.

[2025-04-15 20:14:15.578]         >> Thought (ITALY): Reasoning: Turkey has been eliminated, so the main part of the Lepanto opening strategy is no longer relevant. Italy has only three supply centers and three units, making it the weakest power. Austria and Russia are the strongest powers with 7 supply centers each. The plan was that once Turkey was defeated, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. However, Austria still holds GRE. Thus, I need to request that Austria vacate GRE so that Italy can take it. Additionally, I need to reaffirm non-aggression pacts with France and Germany and continue discussions with England, France, and Germany about a potential coalition against Russia. Another goal is to make a move towards Tunis (TUN). Final Plan: Request Austria to vacate GRE, reaffirm non-aggression pacts with France and Germany, and discuss a coalition against Russia with England, France, and Germany.

[2025-04-15 20:15:25.131]         >> Thought (RUSSIA): Reasoning: Turkey has been eliminated, so the next strategic focus should be on either securing the southern centers against Austria or focusing on the northern front against England or Germany. England has 2 builds available which makes them a significant threat if they aim for the North Sea or Baltic Sea. Germany has 1 build available which makes them a potential ally against England. Austria has 7 centers and might be a next target for expansion. Plan: Propose a joint action against Germany with England where F STP/NC could move to BAL and support an attack on KIE if England makes a move from NTH. Reaffirm non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Germany while proposing a joint action against England if Germany feels threatened. Discuss a potential joint action against Austria with Italy and France.

France wants to reaffirm the DMZ in the English Channel and is open to joint actions against Germany or Russia. Plan: Reaffirm the DMZ in the English Channel with France and propose a joint action against Russia. Negotiate with Germany about Kiel, possibly holding onto it unless a strong alliance against Russia is formed. Agree with Austria and Italy on forming a coalition against Russia. Be cautious with Russia's proposal to attack Germany. Use the two builds to strengthen our position, likely building two fleets in LON and LVP.

[2025-04-15 20:24:17.411]         >> Thought (ENGLAND): Reasoning: England has 2 builds available. Home supply centers are EDI, LON, and LVP. LON is already occupied by A LON. Thus, EDI and LVP are unoccupied. Given the need for a more balanced force and a plan against Russia, it makes sense to build a fleet in Edinburgh (F EDI B) for naval dominance in the North Sea and an army in Liverpool (A LVP B) for land operations such as moving into Belgium or supporting actions in Germany. Final Plan: F EDI B, A LVP B.

The Builds/Disbands Available for Germany is 1. The only unoccupied home supply center that Germany owns is Berlin (BER). Given the naval threats from England (F KIE) and the need for naval power in the Baltic Sea and North Sea, it seems strategic to build a fleet in Berlin. Thus, the plan is to build a fleet in Berlin (F BER B).

However, for the current round (S1970M), a similar round of communication should be made where Turkey acknowledges its elimination and wishes the remaining powers good luck. Final Plan: Send a message to all remaining powers (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia) to wish them good luck.

[2025-04-15 20:33:50.356]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Based on the current game state and the messages received, it seems that the main focus should be on the coalition against Russia. However, Italy has reminded us of a previous agreement where once Turkey was defeated, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. However, Austria still holds GRE. It seems that we need to address Italy's request first while also making plans for a coalition against Russia.

1. **Italy's Request**: Italy has a valid point based on the previous agreement. It makes sense to honor the agreement and vacate GRE so that Italy can take it. However, we need to make sure that our units are well-positioned for any future actions against Russia. A possible move could be to move A GRE to BUL or CON to make room for Italy to take GRE.

2. **Coalition Against Russia**: England, France, and Germany have all expressed interest in forming a coalition against Russia. Given that Russia is the most powerful player currently, it makes strategic sense to join this coalition. However, we need to make sure that our core territories (VIE, BUD, TRI) remain secure while we make plans against Russia.

3. **Russia's Message**: Russia seems to be concerned about the balance of power in the Balkans. It makes sense to reassure Russia that we aim for a stable border and cooperation while secretly making plans with other powers to contain Russian expansion.

4. **Turkey's Message**: Turkey has been eliminated from the game, so their message is a formality. However, it's important to make sure that any remaining Turkish units are fully neutralized.

Based on this reasoning, the plan for this round should be:
   - Send a message to Italy agreeing to vacate GRE and suggesting a plan for a smooth transition (e.g., moving A GRE to BUL or CON).
   - Send a message to England, France, and Germany to make a more concrete plan for a coalition against Russia.
   - Send a message to Russia to reassure them of our intentions for a stable border and continued cooperation while making plans against them with other powers.
   - Update memory to reflect the new agreements and plans made in this round.

[2025-04-15 20:34:44.275]         >> Thought (ENGLAND): Reasoning: Russia is the most powerful player with 7 centers and 7 units. A coalition against Russia makes strategic sense. Austria and Italy are open to a coalition against Russia. France wants to reaffirm the DMZ in the English Channel and continue joint action against Germany, but it might be more strategic to redirect efforts against Russia. Germany wants a joint action against Russia where England vacates Kiel so that Germany can retake it, which might weaken England's position. Russia wants to reaffirm the non-aggression pact and proposes a joint action against Germany. Plan: 1) Reaffirm DMZ in ENG with France and suggest a joint action against Russia. 2) Negotiate with Germany to make a joint action against Russia where England holds Kiel and Germany makes a move against Russia's fleet in the Baltic Sea or Sweden. 3) Express interest in forming a coalition against Russia with Austria and Italy and ask for specific plans. 4) Reaffirm the non-aggression pact with Russia but be cautious about a joint action against Germany until a solid coalition against Russia is formed.

However, Germany should make sure that Austria does not make any aggressive moves towards Germany's core territories such as Munich and Berlin.

Additionally, England might vacate Kiel if Germany agrees to a joint action against Russia. France proposes a joint action against England where France might vacate Ruhr so that Germany can retake it. Italy suggests forming a coalition against Russia. Russia demands that Germany vacate Sweden or face a joint action from Russia and England.

Final Plan: A PAR H, A MAR H, F MAO H, F ENG H, A RUH H.

[2025-04-15 20:46:52.295]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Based on the current game state and the private notes, it seems that Turkey has been fully defeated and the main focus now should be on making a plan against Russia. The plan previously agreed upon was that once Turkey was defeated, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. However, it seems that Russia has already taken BUL which was part of the plan for Austria to keep. Thus, a new agreement where Austria should aim to keep CON and GRE while Russia keeps BUL and ANK once Turkey is defeated seems to be the current plan. However, there seems to be a need for a coalition against Russia now that Turkey is out of the game. 

Based on the current game state, Russia has a significant number of units and supply centers (7 centers: MOS, SEV, STP, WAR, RUM, BUL, ANK). It makes sense to make a plan against Russia to prevent them from becoming too powerful. 

1. **Communicate with Italy**: Reaffirm the non-aggression pact where Austria does not move into VEN or ADR and Italy does not move into TRI or ALB. Discuss the need for a plan against Russia now that Turkey is defeated. Reaffirm that GRE should go to Italy as previously agreed upon. 
2. **Communicate with England, France, and Germany**: Acknowledge their proposals for a coalition against Russia and express agreement. Reaffirm non-aggression pacts where necessary and make sure that no aggressive moves are made towards Austria's core territories (VIE, BUD, TRI). 
3. **Communicate with Russia**: Reaffirm the plan where ANK should go to Russia and SMY should go to Austria once Turkey is defeated. However, make sure that no aggressive moves are made towards each other's core territories once Turkey is out. 

Based on this reasoning, the plan for this round should be to send messages to Italy, England, France, Germany, and Russia to make a plan against Russia while ensuring that the previously agreed upon distribution of Turkish territories is respected.

The only valid retreat for F KIE is to HEL if it is not occupied. However, it might be more strategic to disband F KIE if HEL is already occupied or if it makes us appear weaker. Another important point is that Russia is a major power now with 7 centers, so a coalition against Russia might be a strategic priority. I need to make a joint action proposal against Russia with Germany and France. Additionally, I need to make sure that France does not make any aggressive moves in the English Channel. Plan: Propose a DMZ in the English Channel to France, make a joint action against Russia with Germany and France, and update memory.

[2025-04-15 20:48:48.206]         >> Thought (FRANCE): Reasoning: England has a strong presence in the North Sea and a unit in KIE which is a significant threat to Germany. Germany seems to be under pressure from England and might be open to an alliance against England. Italy is in a weaker position and might be looking for alliances to expand. Russia is the strongest power currently and might be a significant threat to other powers such as Austria and Italy. Austria seems to be in a strong position and might be a potential ally against Russia. Plan: Reaffirm DMZ in ENG with England and propose a joint action against Germany such as a coordinated attack on Holland (HOL) or Kiel (KIE). Reaffirm DMZ in BUR with Germany and propose a joint action against England such as retaking Belgium (BEL) or Holland (HOL). Reaffirm non-aggression pact with Italy and discuss a future coalition against Russia. Make a well-coordinated plan with Russia for a future alliance against Germany.

However, it is important to make sure that Austria does not become a threat in the Balkans. Thus, reaffirming the joint action against Germany with England and France should be a priority. Additionally, checking in with Austria to ensure that the previous agreement still holds is important. Reaffirming the non-aggression pact and DMZ in Baltic Sea and Galicia with Germany should be done while making sure that Germany does not make any aggressive moves against Russia. Finally, discussing a potential joint action against Austria with Italy might be a good idea if Italy feels threatened by Austria's growing power in the Balkans. Final Plan: Propose joint action against Germany with England and France, check in with Austria, reaffirm non-aggression pact with Germany, and discuss potential joint action against Austria with Italy.

[2025-04-15 20:52:23.849]         >> Thought (AUSTRIA): Based on the current game state and the messages received, it seems that the main focus now is on forming a coalition against Russia. Since Turkey has been eliminated, the main threat appears to be Russia, which has a significant number of units and supply centers. The messages from England, France, and Germany all indicate a willingness to form a coalition against Russia. However, Italy has requested that Austria vacate Greece so that Italy can take control of it, which was part of a previous agreement where once Turkey was defeated, ANK should go to Russia, SMY should go to Austria, and GRE should go to Italy. 

Based on this, the plan for this round should be:
1. Reaffirm the agreement with Italy that Greece should be vacated so that Italy can take control of it. However, it is important to make sure that Italy is still part of the coalition against Russia.
2. Reaffirm the alliance with Russia while secretly making plans with England, France, and Germany for a coalition against Russia. It is important to keep Russia unaware of the coalition plans until the right moment.
3. Make a plan for a smooth transition such as moving the unit in Greece (A GRE) to another location such as Bulgaria (BUL) or Constantinople (CON).
4. Update the memory to reflect the new round of negotiations and the plans made.
