== CURRENT GAME SUMMARY ==
The game has just begun.

== CURRENT SITUATION ==
Phase: S1901M
Your Interaction Step: NEGOTIATION_ROUND_1

== CURRENT GAME STATE ==
  Your Units: F BRE, A MAR, A PAR
  All Units: {"AUSTRIA": [["A", "BUD"], ["A", "VIE"], ["F", "TRI"]], "ENGLAND": [["F", "EDI"], ["F", "LON"], ["A", "LVP"]], "FRANCE": [["F", "BRE"], ["A", "MAR"], ["A", "PAR"]], "GERMANY": [["F", "KIE"], ["A", "BER"], ["A", "MUN"]], "ITALY": [["F", "NAP"], ["A", "ROM"], ["A", "VEN"]], "RUSSIA": [["A", "WAR"], ["A", "MOS"], ["F", "SEV"], ["F", "STP/SC"]], "TURKEY": [["F", "ANK"], ["A", "CON"], ["A", "SMY"]]}

== MESSAGES RECEIVED THIS STEP ==
  (None)

== INSTRUCTIONS & AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION ==
Your response MUST be a valid JSON list containing allowed tool calls.
Pay EXTREME attention to JSON syntax and required arguments.

Goal: Communicate with other powers, gather info, propose deals, update your memory. Current round: 1
REQUIRED STEP: Use log_thought FIRST. In its 'thought' argument, provide your reasoning: analyze messages/state, decide communication strategy (who to talk to, what to say/ask), and summarize your planned actions for this round.

Allowed Tools for Negotiation:
  - log_thought(thought: str) # Use FIRST. Include detailed reasoning and plan for this round.
  - send_message(recipient: str, message_type: str, content: str) # Recipient MUST be a major power name.
  - update_memory(key: str, value: any)

IMPORTANT: End response list with finish_negotiation_round tool call:
  - finish_negotiation_round()

Example Final JSON Structure (Negotiation):
```json
[
  { "tool_name": "log_thought", "arguments": { "thought": "Reasoning: Need to check England's intentions in ENG. Proposal for DMZ seems safe. Germany is quiet, maybe propose BUR DMZ. Memory: Record proposals. Final Plan: Propose ENG DMZ to ENGLAND, propose BUR DMZ to GERMANY, update memory." } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "ENGLAND", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "How about a DMZ in the English Channel this year?" } },
  { "tool_name": "send_message", "arguments": { "recipient": "GERMANY", "message_type": "PROPOSAL", "content": "Friendly opening? DMZ Burgundy?" } },
  { "tool_name": "update_memory", "arguments": { "key": "S1901M_prop", "value": "Proposed DMZ ENG(E), BUR(G)" } },
  { "tool_name": "finish_negotiation_round", "arguments": {} }
]
```

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the JSON list of tool calls as your response. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting like ```json markers before or after the list.
Your response MUST start with '[' and end with ']'.

Now, provide your JSON response:

  From ENGLAND: To avoid early conflict, how about a DMZ in the English Channel this year? I suggest that your fleet in Brest moves to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of Lyon while my fleet in London moves to the North Sea.
  From GERMANY: Hello, France. To avoid any early conflict, how about a DMZ in Burgundy (BUR) for this year? This way, we can both focus on other areas.
  From ITALY: Hello France, I propose a non-aggression pact where I do not move into Piedmont and you do not move into Piedmont. This should help us both focus on other fronts.
