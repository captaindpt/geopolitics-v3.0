I plan to negotiate a 'Channel Alliance' with England where we avoid conflict in the English Channel (e.g., F BRE to MAO while F LON goes to NTH). I need to make a strategic agreement with Germany regarding Belgium (e.g., A PAR to BUR and F BRE to MAO while Germany moves A MUN to RUH). I should also discuss a non-aggression pact with Italy where I move A MAR to SPA and F BRE to MAO, while Italy focuses on Austria or Turkey."
