England could be a potential ally against France or a rival in the North Sea. Russia is a neighbor to the east where a mutual non-aggression could allow us to focus on the west. Austria shares a southern border where a non-aggression pact could prevent a two-front conflict. Italy might be less of an immediate threat, but a diplomatic check-in could be useful. Plan: Propose non-aggression pacts with France, Russia, Austria, and Italy. Gauge England's intentions and possibly form an alliance against France."
